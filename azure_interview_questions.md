        Use two fault domains.
        2 or 3 is max value, depending on which region you are in.
        Use 20 for platformUpdateDomainCount
        Increasing the update domain (platformUpdateDomainCount) helps with capacity and availability planning when the platform reboots nodes. A higher number for the pool (20 is max) means that fewer of their nodes in any given availability set would be rebooted at once.

        QUESTION 3
        You need to define a custom domain name for Azure AD to support the planned infrastructure. Which domain name should you use?
        A. ad.humongousinsurance.com
        B. humingousinsurance.onmicrosoft.com
        C. humongousinsurance.com
        D. humongousinsurance.local
        Correct Answer: C Section: [none] Explanation
        Explanation/Reference:
        Explanation:
        Every Azure AD directory comes with an initial domain name in the form of domainname.onmicrosoft.com. The initial domain name cannot be changed or deleted, but you can add your corporate domain name to Azure AD as well. For example, your organization probably has other domain names used to do business and users who sign in using your corporate domain name. Adding custom domain names to Azure AD allows you to assign user names in the directory that are familiar to your users, such as ‘alice@contoso.com.’ instead of 'alice@domain name.onmicrosoft.com'.
        Scenario:
        Network Infrastructure: Each office has a local data center that contains all the servers for that office. Each office has a dedicated connection to the Internet.
        Humongous Insurance has a single-domain Active Directory forest named humongousinsurance.com
        Planned Azure AD Infrastructure: The on-premises Active Directory domain will be synchronized to Azure AD.

        Section: [none] Explanation
        Explanation/Reference:
        Explanation:
        Step 1: Install the Azure File Sync agent on Server1
        The Azure File Sync agent is a downloadable package that enables Windows Server to be synced with an Azure file share
        Step 2: Register Server1.
        Register Windows Server with Storage Sync Service
        Registering your Windows Server with a Storage Sync Service establishes a trust relationship between your server (or cluster) and the Storage Sync Service.
        Step 3: Add a server endpoint
        Create a sync group and a cloud endpoint.
        A sync group defines the sync topology for a set of files. Endpoints within a sync group are kept in sync with each other. A sync group must contain one cloud endpoint, which represents an Azure file share and one or more server endpoints. A server endpoint represents a path on registered server.

        You have an Azure virtual machine named VM1 that you use for testing. VM1 is protected by Azure Backup. You delete VM1.
        You need to remove the backup data stored for VM1. What should you do first?
        A. Delete the Recovery Services vault.
        B. Delete the storage account.
        C. Stop the backup
        D. Modify the backup policy.
        Correct Answer: D Section: [none] Explanation
        Explanation/Reference:
        Explanation:
        Azure Backup provides backup for virtual machines — created through both the classic deployment model and the Azure Resource Manager deployment model — by using custom-defined backup policies in a Recovery Services vault.
        With the release of backup policy management, customers can manage backup policies and model them to meet their changing requirements from a single window. Customers can edit a policy, associate more virtual machines to a policy, and delete unnecessary policies to meet their compliance requirements.
        Incorrect Answers:
        B: You can't delete a Recovery Services vault if it is registered to a server and holds backup data. If you try to delete a vault, but can't, the vault is still configured to receive backup data.

        Select and Place:
        Correct Answer:
        Section: [none] Explanation
        Explanation/Reference:
        Explanation:
        Step 1: Stop VM1, VM, and VM3.
        If the VM you wish to resize is part of an availability set, then you must stop all VMs in the availability set before changing the size of any VM in the availability set. The reason all VMs in the availability set must be stopped before performing the resize operation to a size that requires different hardware is that all running VMs in the availability set must be using the same physical hardware cluster. Therefore, if a change of
        physical hardware cluster is required to change the VM size then all VMs must be first stopped and then restarted one-by-one to a different physical hardware clusters.
        Step 2: Resize VM1.
        Step 3: Start VM1, VM2, and VM3. References: https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/blog/resize-virtual-machines/
        QUESTION 12
        You plan to back up an Azure virtual machine named VM1.
        You discover that the Backup Pre-Check status displays a status of Warning. What is a possible cause of the Warning status?
        A. VM1 is stopped.
        B. VM1 does not have the latest version of WaAppAgent.exe installed.
        C. VM1 has an unmanaged disk.
        D. A Recovery Services vault is unavailable.
        Correct Answer: B Section: [none] Explanation
        Explanation/Reference:
        Explanation:
        The Warning state indicates one or more issues in VM’s configuration that might lead to backup failures and provides recommended steps to ensure successful backups. Not having the latest VM Agent installed, for example, can cause backups to fail intermittently and falls in this class of issues.

        Overview
        Contoso, Ltd. is a consulting company that has a main office in Montreal and two branch offices in Seattle and New York.
        The Montreal office has 2,000 employees. The Seattle office has 1,000 employees. The New York office has 200 employees.
        All the resources used by Contoso are hosted on-premises.
        Contoso creates a new Azure subscription. The Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant uses a domain named contoso.onmicrosoft.com. The tenant uses the P1 pricing tier.
        Existing Environment
        The network contains an Active Directory forest named contoso.com. All domain controllers are configured as DNS servers and host the contoso.com DNS zone.
        Contoso has finance, human resources, sales, research, and information technology departments. Each department has an organizational unit (OU) that contains all the accounts of that respective department. All the user accounts have the department attribute set to their respective department. New users are added frequently.
        Contoso.com contains a user named User1. All the offices connect by using private links.
        Contoso has data centers in the Montreal and Seattle offices. Each data center has a firewall that can be configured as a VPN device.
        All infrastructure servers are virtualized. The virtualization environment contains the servers in the following table.
        Contoso uses two web applications named App1 and App2. Each instance on each web application requires 1GB of memory.
        The Azure subscription contains the resources in the following table.
        The network security team implements several network security groups (NSGs).
        Planned Changes
        Contoso plans to implement the following changes: Deploy Azure ExpressRoute to the Montreal office.
        Migrate the virtual machines hosted on Server1 and Server2 to Azure. Synchronize on-premises Active Directory to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Migrate App1 and App2 to two Azure web apps named WebApp1 and WebApp2.
        Technical requirements
        Contoso must meet the following technical requirements:
        Ensure that WebApp1 can adjust the number of instances automatically based on the load and can scale up to five instances.
        Ensure that VM3 can establish outbound connections over TCP port 8080 to the applications servers in the Montreal office.
        Ensure that routing information is exchanged automatically between Azure and the routers in the Montreal office.
        Ensure Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the users in the finance department only. Ensure that webapp2.azurewebsites.net can be accessed by using the name app2.contoso.com Connect the New York office to VNet1 over the Internet by using an encrypted connection.
        Create a workflow to send an email message when the settings of VM4 are modified. Create a custom Azure role named Role1 that is based on the Reader role.
        Minimize costs whenever possible.
        QUESTION 1

        Explanation:
        Scenario: Contoso must meet technical requirements including:
        Ensure that VM3 can establish outbound connections over TCP port 8080 to the applications servers in the Montreal office.
        IP flow verify checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a virtual machine. The information consists of direction, protocol, local IP, remote IP, local port, and remote port. If the packet is denied by a security group, the name of the rule that denied the packet is returned. While any source or destination IP can be chosen, IP flow verify helps administrators quickly diagnose connectivity issues from or to the internet and from or to the on-premises environment.

        You have two subscriptions named Subscription1 and Subscription2. Each subscription is associated to a different Azure AD tenant.
        Subscription1 contains a virtual network named VNet1. VNet1 contains an Azure virtual machine named VM1 and has an IP address space of 10.0.0.0/16.
        Subscription2 contains a virtual network named VNet2. VNet2 contains an Azure virtual machine named VM2 and has an IP address space of 10.10.0.0/24.
        You need to connect VNet1 to VNet2. What should you do first?
        A. Move VM1 to Subscription2.
        B. Modify the IP address space of VNet2.
        C. Provision virtual network gateways.
        D. Move VNet1 to Subscription2.
        Correct Answer: C Section: [none] Explanation
        Explanation/Reference:
        Explanation:
        The virtual networks can be in the same or different regions, and from the same or different subscriptions. When connecting VNets from different subscriptions, the subscriptions do not need to be associated with the same Active Directory tenant.
        Configuring a VNet-to-VNet connection is a good way to easily connect VNets. Connecting a virtual network to another virtual network using the VNet-to-VNet connection type (VNet2VNet) is similar to creating a Site- to-Site IPsec connection to an on-premises location. Both connectivity types use a VPN gateway to provide a secure tunnel using IPsec/IKE, and both function the same way when communicating.
        The local network gateway for each VNet treats the other VNet as a local site. This lets you specify additional address space for the local network gateway in order to route traffic.

        Correct Answer: BC Section: [none] Explanation
        Explanation/Reference:
        Explanation:
        B: A VPN gateway is used when creating a VPN connection to your on-premises network.
        Route-based VPN devices use any-to-any (wildcard) traffic selectors, and let routing/forwarding tables direct traffic to different IPsec tunnels. It is typically built on router platforms where each IPsec tunnel is modeled as a network interface or VTI (virtual tunnel interface).
        C: Policy-based VPN devices use the combinations of prefixes from both networks to define how traffic is encrypted/decrypted through IPsec tunnels. It is typically built on firewall devices that perform packet filtering. IPsec tunnel encryption and decryption are added to the packet filtering and processing engine.
        Incorrect Answers:
        D: Point-to-Site connections do not require a VPN device or a public-facing IP address.

        You can connect one VNet to another VNet using either a Virtual network peering, or an Azure VPN Gateway.
        To create a virtual network gateway
        Step 1: In the portal, on the left side, click +Create a resource and type 'virtual network gateway' in search. Locate Virtual network gateway in the search return and click the entry. On the Virtual network gateway page, click Create at the bottom of the page to open the Create virtual network gateway page.
        Step 2: On the Create virtual network gateway page, fill in the values for your virtual network gateway.
        Name: Name your gateway. This is not the same as naming a gateway subnet. It's the name of the gateway object you are creating.
        Gateway type: Select VPN. VPN gateways use the virtual network gateway type VPN.
        Virtual network: Choose the virtual network to which you want to add this gateway. Click Virtual network to open the 'Choose a virtual network' page. Select the VNet. If you don't see your VNet, make sure the Location field is pointing to the region in which your virtual network is located.
        Gateway subnet address range: You will only see this setting if you did not previously create a gateway subnet for your virtual network. If you previously created a valid gateway subnet, this setting will not appear.
        Step 4: Select Create New to create a Gateway subnet.
        Step 5: Click Create to begin creating the VPN gateway. The settings are validated and you'll see the "Deploying Virtual network gateway" tile on the dashboard. Creating a gateway can take up to 45 minutes. You may need to refresh your portal page to see the completed status.

        Correct Answer:
        Section: [none] Explanation
        Explanation/Reference:
        Explanation:
        IP forwarding enables the virtual machine a network interface is attached to:
        Receive network traffic not destined for one of the IP addresses assigned to any of the IP configurations assigned to the network interface.
        Send network traffic with a different source IP address than the one assigned to one of a network interface's IP configurations.
        The setting must be enabled for every network interface that is attached to the virtual machine that receives traffic that the virtual machine needs to forward. A virtual machine can forward traffic whether it has multiple network interfaces or a single network interface attached to it.
        Box 1: Yes
        The routing table allows connections from VM3 to VM1 and VM2. And as IP forwarding is enabled on VM3, VM3 can connect to VM1.
        Box 2: No
        VM3, which has IP forwarding, must be turned on, in order for VM2 to connect to VM1.

        –UserPrincipalName user1@outlook.com parameter.
        Correct Answer: D Section: [none] Explanation
        Explanation/Reference:
        Explanation:
        UserPrincipalName - contains the UserPrincipalName (UPN) of this user. The UPN is what the user will use when they sign in into Azure AD. The common structure is @, so for Abby Brown in Contoso.com, the UPN would be AbbyB@contoso.com
        Example:
        To create the user, call the New-AzureADUser cmdlet with the parameter values:
        powershell New-AzureADUser -AccountEnabled $True -DisplayName "Abby Brown" -PasswordProfile
        $PasswordProfile -MailNickName "AbbyB" -UserPrincipalName "AbbyB@contoso.com"

        Default Azure system routes that will be the only routes used to route traffic
        A virtual network named Paris-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet1 and Subnet2 A virtual network named ClientResources-VNet that will contain one subnet named ClientSubnet
        A virtual network named AllOffices-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet3 and Subnet4
        You plan to enable peering between Paris-VNet and AllOffices-VNet. You will enable the Use remote gateways setting for the Paris-VNet peerings.
        You plan to create a private DNS zone named humongousinsurance.local and set the registration network to the ClientResources-VNet virtual network.
        Planned Azure Computer Infrastructure
        Each subnet will contain several virtual machines that will run either Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, or Red Hat Linux.
        Department Requirements
        Humongous Insurance identifies the following requirements for the company's departments:
        Web administrators will deploy Azure web apps for the marketing department. Each web app will be added to a separate resource group. The initial configuration of the web apps will be identical. The web administrators have permission to deploy web apps to resource groups.
        During the testing phase, auditors in the finance department must be able to review all Azure costs from the past week.
        Authentication Requirements
        Users in the Miami office must use Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-on (Azure AD Seamless SSO) when accessing resources in Azure.
        QUESTION 1
        You need to prepare the environment to meet the authentication requirements.
        Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.
        NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
        A. Install the Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) role on a domain controller in the Miami office.
        B. Allow inbound TCP port 8080 to the domain controllers in the Miami office.
        C. Join the client computers in the Miami office to Azure AD.

        E. Install Azure AD Connect on a server in the Miami office and enable Pass-through Authentication.
        Correct Answer: DE Section: [none] Explanation
        Explanation/Reference:
        Explanation:
        D: You can gradually roll out Seamless SSO to your users. You start by adding the following Azure AD URL to all or selected users' Intranet zone settings by using Group Policy in Active Directory: https:// autologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com
        E: Seamless SSO works with any method of cloud authentication - Password Hash Synchronization or Pass-through Authentication, and can be enabled via Azure AD Connect.
        Incorrect Answers:
        A: Seamless SSO is not applicable to Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS). B: Azure AD connect does not port 8080. It uses port 443.
        C: Seamless SSO needs the user's device to be domain-joined, but doesn't need for the device to be Azure AD Joined.
        Scenario: Users in the Miami office must use Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-on (Azure AD Seamless SSO) when accessing resources in Azure.
        Planned Azure AD Infrastructure include: The on-premises Active Directory domain will be synchronized to Azure AD.
