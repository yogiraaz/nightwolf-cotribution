# Linux Level-2 Questions
---

        1. Please explain Linux booting processing? 

        2. Difference between RHEL6 and RHEL7 booting process.

        3. Difference between systemd and initd.
           Hint =>
                "Systemd" is an enhanced version of "init". "sysytemd" was launched with RHEL 7.x has capability
                to start the services in parallel. Please refer to below table for more information.

               using "lsmod" command

        6. How to load kernel module. any commands ?
            Hint =>
                        We can use "modprobe" or "insmod" commands to load kernel module.

        7. How to blacklist a module.


        8. Explain the below error:

                -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 No filesystem could mount root, tried:
                [    4.471120] Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
                -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        9. Explain few examples of kernel panic.
            Hint =>
               A kernel panic is one of several Linux boot issues. In basic terms, it is a situation when the kernel
               can't load properly and therefore the system fails to boot. During the boot process, the kernel does
               not load directly. Instead, initramfs loads in RAM, then it points to the kernel (vmlinuz), and then
               the operating system boots. If initramfs gets corrupted or deleted at this stage because of recent 
               OS patching, updates, or other causes, then we face a kernel panic.
    
               Causes of Kernel panics:
                 a). If the initramfs file gets corrupted.
                 b). If initramfs is not created properly for the specified kernel. Every kernel version has its own
                     corresponding initramfs.
                 c). If the installed kernel is not supported or not installed correctly.
                 d). If recent patches have some flaws.
                 e). If a module has been installed from online or another source, but the initrd image is not 
                     created with the latest installed module.

        10. What is an oops in terms of Kernel?
           Hint =>
               An oops indicates a kernel bug and should always be reported and fixed.
               When an oops occurs, the system will print out information that is relevent to debugging the problem,
               like the contents of all the CPU registers, and the location of page descriptor tables.
               In particular, the contents of the EIP (instruction pointer) is printed. Like this:

                   EIP: 0010:[<00000000>]
                   Call Trace: [<c010b860>]

               An oops is not a kernel panic. In a panic, the kernel cannot continue; the system grinds to a halt and
               must be restarted. An oops may cause a panic if a vital part of the system is destroyed. An oops in a 
               device driver, for example, will almost never cause a panic.

         11. What is "nohup" used for?
             Hint =>
                 nohup is a POSIX command which means "no hang up". Its purpose is to execute a command such that it
                 ignores the HUP (hangup) signal and therefore does not stop when the user logs out. Output that 
                 would normally go to the terminal goes to a file called nohup.

                 ## nuhup Syntax:
                        nohup command [command-argument ...]

         12. How to troubleshoot a issue where a client not able to access a server?

         13. What are outputs when you execute the NATCAT (nc) command  and explain each ?
             Hint =>
                - Connected
                - Connection timeout
                - Connection refused(if port / server is blocking by the firewall)

         14. How can we check the packet flow in our system?
             Hint => 
                 We can use "tcpdump" command to check the incoming and outgoing packets.

         15. what is the steal value in top command?

         16. What is tcpwrappers?
             Hint =>
                tcpwrappers is a host based Network Access Control List, by which we can allow or deny a host or
                subnetwork IP addresses. Files used by tcpwrappr for access control are /etc/hosts.allow and 
                /etc/hosts.deny.

         17. Describe how 'ps' works.
            Hint =>
               On Linux, the ps command works by reading files in the proc filesystem. The directory '/proc/PID'
               contains various files that provide information about process PID. The content of these files is
               generated on the fly by the kernel when a process reads them.
               You can use 'strace' command to actually see how ps works.

             How can you achieve it?
             Hint => 
                We can use "tee" command to do this. Below is the command expamle: 
             
                /sbin/ifconfig | tee FILE_NAME
