80. What is command fmt?
The
terraform
fmt
command is used to rewrite Terraform configuration files to a canonical format and style. This command applies a subset of the
Terraform language style conventions
, along with other minor adjustments for readability.
81. What is the recommended approach after upgrading terraform?
The canonical format may change in minor ways between Terraform versions, so after upgrading Terraform we recommend to proactively run
terraform fmt
on your modules along with any other changes you are making to adopt the new version.
82. What is the command usage?
terraform fmt [options] [DIR]
83. By default,
fmt
scans the current directory for configuration files. Is this true?

https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 25/72
True
By default,
fmt
scans the current directory for configuration files. If the
dir
argument is provided then it will scan that given directory instead. If
dir
is a single dash (
-
) then
fmt
will read from standard input (STDIN).
84. You are formatting the configuration files and what is the flag you should use tosee the differences?
terraform fmt -diff
85. You are formatting the configuration files and what is the flag you should use toprocess the subdirectories as well?
terraform fmt -recursive
86. You are formatting configuration files in a lot of directories and you don’t wantto see the list of file changes. What is the flag that you should use?
terraform fmt -list=false
87. What is the command taint?
The
terraform
taint
command manually marks a Terraform-managed resource as tainted, forcing it to be destroyed and recreated on the next apply.
This command
will not
modify infrastructure, but does modify the state file in order to mark a resource as tainted. Once a resource is marked as tainted, the next
plan
will show that the resource will be destroyed and recreated and the next
apply
will implement this change.
88. What is the command usage?

https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 26/72
terraform taint [options] address
The
address
argument is the address of the resource to mark as tainted. The address is in
the resource address syntax
syntax
89. When you are tainting a resource terraform reads the default state fileterraform.tfstate. What is the flag you should use to read from a different path?
terraform taint -state=path
90. Give an example of tainting a single resource?
terraform taint aws_security_group.allow_all
The resource aws_security_group.allow_all in the module root has been marked as tainted.
91. Give an example of tainting a resource within a module?
terraform taint "module.couchbase.aws_instance.cb_node[9]"
Resource instance module.couchbase.aws_instance.cb_node[9] has been marked as tainted.
92. What is the command import?
The
terraform import
command is used to
import existing resources
into Terraform.
Terraform is able to import existing infrastructure. This allows you take resources you've created by some other means and bring it under Terraform management.
This is a great way to slowly transition infrastructure to Terraform, or to be able to be confident that you can use Terraform in the future if it potentially doesn't support every feature you need today.

https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 27/72
93. What is the command import usage?
terraform import [options] ADDRESS ID
94. What is the default workspace name?
default
95. What are workspaces?
Each Terraform configuration has an associated
backend
that defines how operations are executed and where persistent data such as
the Terraform state
are stored.
The persistent data stored in the backend belongs to a
workspace
. Initially the backend has only one workspace, called "default", and thus there is only one Terraform state associated with that configuration.
Certain backends support
multiple
named workspaces, allowing multiple states to be associated with a single configuration.
96. What is the command to list the workspaces?
terraform workspace list
97. What is the command to create a new workspace?
terraform workspace new <name>
98. What is the command to show the current workspace?
terraform workspace show

99. What is the command to switch the workspace?
terraform workspace select <workspace name>
100. What is the command to delete the workspace?
terraform workspace delete <workspace name>
101. Can you delete the default workspace?
No. You can't ever delete default workspace
102. You are working on the different workspaces and you want to use a differentnumber of instances based on the workspace. How do you achieve that?
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
count
=
"${terraform.workspace == "default" ? 5 : 1}"
# ... other arguments
}
103. You are working on the different workspaces and you want to use tags based onthe workspace. How do you achieve that?
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
tags
=
{
Name
=
"web - ${terraform.workspace}"
}
# ... other arguments
}
104. You want to create a parallel, distinct copy of a set of infrastructure in order totest a set of changes before modifying the main production infrastructure. How doyou achieve that?

105. What is the command state?
The
terraform state
command is used for advanced state management. As your Terraform usage becomes more advanced, there are some cases where you may need to modify the
Terraform state
. Rather than modify the state directly, the
terraform state
commands can be used in many cases instead.
https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/state/index.html
106. What is the command usage?
terraform state <subcommand> [options] [args]
107. You are working on terraform files and you want to list all the resources. Whatis the command you should use?
terraform state list
108. How do you list the resources for the given name?
terraform state list <resource name>
109. What is the command that shows the attributes of a single resource in the statefile?
terraform state show 'resource name'
110. How do you do debugging terraform?
17/01/2022, 23:18 250 Practice Questions For Terraform Associate Certifi cation | by Bhargav Bachina | Bachina Labs | Medium
https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 30/72
Terraform has detailed logs which can be enabled by setting the
TF_LOG
environment variable to any value.
This will cause detailed logs to appear on stderr.
You can set
TF_LOG
to one of the log levels
TRACE
,
DEBUG
,
INFO
,
WARN
or
ERROR
to change the verbosity of the logs.
TRACE
is the most verbose and it is the default if
TF_LOG
is set to something other than a log level name.
To persist logged output you can set
TF_LOG_PATH
in order to force the log to always be appended to a specific file when logging is enabled.
Note that even when
TF_LOG_PATH
is set,
TF_LOG
must be set in order for any logging to be enabled.
https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/debugging.html
111. If terraform crashes where should you see the logs?
crash.log
If Terraform ever crashes (a "panic" in the Go runtime), it saves a log file with the debug logs from the session as well as the panic message and backtrace to
crash.log
.
https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/debugging.html
112. What is the first thing you should do when the terraform crashes?
panic message
The most interesting part of a crash log is the panic message itself and the backtrace immediately following. So the first thing to do is to search the file for
panic
https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/debugging.html
113. You are building infrastructure for different environments for example testand dev. How do you maintain separate states?
17/01/2022, 23:18 250 Practice Questions For Terraform Associate Certifi cation | by Bhargav Bachina | Bachina Labs | Medium
https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 31/72
There are two primary methods to separate state between environments:
directories
workspaces
114. What is the difference between directory-separated and workspace-separatedenvironments?
Directory separated environments rely on duplicate Terraform code, which may be useful if your deployments need differ, for example to test infrastructure changes in development. But they can run the risk of creating drift between the environments over time.
Workspace-separated environments use the same Terraform code but have different state files, which is useful if you want your environments to stay as similar to each other as possible, for example if you are providing development infrastructure to a team that wants to simulate running in production.
115. What is the command to pull the remote state?
terraform state pull
This command will download the state from its current location and output the raw format to stdout.
https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/state/pull.html
116. What is the command is used manually to upload a local state file to a remotestate
terraform state push
The
terraform state push
command is used to manually upload a local state file to
remote state
. This command also works with local state.
https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/state/push.html

117. The command terraform taint modifies the state file and doesn’t modify theinfrastructure. Is this true?
True
This command
will not
modify infrastructure, but does modify the state file in order to mark a resource as tainted. Once a resource is marked as tainted, the next
plan
will show that the resource will be destroyed and recreated and the next
apply
will implement this change.
118. Your team has decided to use terraform in your company and you have existinginfrastructure. How do you migrate your existing resources to terraform and startusing it?
You should use terraform import and modify the infrastrcuture in the terraform files and do the terraform workflow (init, plan, apply)
119. When you are working with the workspaces how do you access the currentworkspace in the configuration files?
${terraform.workspace}
120. When you are using workspaces where does the Terraform save the state file forthe local state?
terraform.tfstate.d
For local state, Terraform stores the workspace states in a directory called
terraform.tfstate.d
.
121. When you are using workspaces where does the Terraform save the state file forthe remote state?
17/01/2022, 23:18 250 Practice Questions For Terraform Associate Certifi cation | by Bhargav Bachina | Bachina Labs | Medium
https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 33/72
For
remote state
, the workspaces are stored directly in the configured
backend
.
122. How do you remove items from the Terraform state?
terraform state rm 'packet_device.worker'
The
terraform state rm
command is used to remove items from the
Terraform state
. This command can remove single resources, single instances of a resource, entire modules, and more.
https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/state/rm.html
123. How do you move the state from one source to another?
terraform state mv 'module.app' 'module.parent.module.app'
The
terraform state mv
command is used to move items in a
Terraform state
. This command can move single resources, single instances of a resource, entire modules, and more. This command can also move items to a completely different state file, enabling efficient refactoring.
https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/state/mv.html
124. How do you rename a resource in the terraform state file?
terraform state mv 'packet_device.worker' 'packet_device.helper'
The above example renames the
packet_device
resource named
worker
to
helper
:

Interact with module inputs and outputs
Describe variable scope within modules/child modules
Discover modules from the public Terraform Module Registry
Defining module version
125. Where do you find and explore terraform Modules?
The
Terraform Registry
makes it simple to find and use modules.
The search query will look at module name, provider, and description to match your search terms. On the results page, filters can be used further refine search results.
126. How do you make sure that modules have stability and compatibility?
By default, only
verified modules
are shown in search results.
Verified modules are reviewed by HashiCorp to ensure stability and compatibility.
By using the filters, you can view unverified modules as well.
127. How do you download any modules?
You need to add any module in the configuration file like below
module "consul" {
source
=
"hashicorp/consul/aws"
version
=
"0.1.0"
}
terraform init
command will download and cache any modules referenced by a configuration.
128. What is the syntax for referencing a registry module?
<NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>

https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 35/72
// for example
module "consul" {
source =
"hashicorp/consul/aws"
version
=
"0.1.0"
}
129. What is the syntax for referencing a private registry module?
<HOSTNAME>/<NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>
// for example
module "vpc" {
source
=
"
app.terraform.io/example_corp/vpc/aws
"
version
=
"0.9.3"
}
130. The terraform recommends that all modules must follow semantic versioning.Is this true?
True
131. What is a Terraform Module?
A Terraform module is a set of Terraform configuration files in a single directory. Even a simple configuration consisting of a single directory with one or more
.tf
files is a module.
132. Why do we use modules for?
* Organize configuration
* Encapsulate configuration
* Re-use configuration
* Provide consistency and ensure best practices
https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/modules/modules-overview
133. How do you call modules in your configuration?
17/01/2022, 23:18 250 Practice Questions For Terraform Associate Certifi cation | by Bhargav Bachina | Bachina Labs | Medium
https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 36/72
Your configuration can use module blocks to call modules in other directories.
When Terraform encounters a module block, it loads and processes that module's configuration files.
134. How many ways you can load modules?
Local and remote modules
Modules can either be loaded from the local filesystem, or a remote source.
Terraform supports a variety of remote sources, including the Terraform Registry, most version control systems, HTTP URLs, and Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise private module registries.
135. What are the best practices for using Modules?
1. Start writing your configuration with modules in mind. Even for modestly complex Terraform configurations managed by a single person, you'll find the benefits of using modules outweigh the time it takes to use them properly.
2. Use local modules to organize and encapsulate your code. Even if you aren't using or publishing remote modules, organizing your configuration in terms of modules from the beginning will significantlty reduce the burden of maintaining and updating your configuration as your infrastructure grows in complexity.
3. Use the public Terraform Registry to find useful modules. This way you can more quickly and confidently implement your configuration by relying on the work of others to implement common infrastructure scenarios.
4. Publish and share modules with your team. Most infrastructure is managed by a team of people, and modules are important way that teams can work together to create and maintain infrastructure. As mentioned earlier, you can publish modules either publicly or privately. We will see how to do this in a future guide in this series.

Local paths
Terraform Registry
GitHub
Generic
Git
,
Mercurial
repositories
Bitbucket
HTTP URLs
S3 buckets
GCS buckets
https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html
137. What are the arguments you need for using modules in your configuration?
source and version
// example
module "consul" {
source = "hashicorp/consul/aws"
version
=
"0.1.0"
}
138. How do you set input variables for the modules?
The configuration that calls a module is responsible for setting its input values, which are passed as arguments in the module block. Aside from
source
and
version
, most of the arguments to a module block will set variable values.
On the Terraform registry page for the AWS VPC module, you will see an
Inputs
tab that describes all of the
input variables
that module supports.
For example, we have defined a lot of input variables for the modules such as ads, cidr,name, etc

Module outputs are usually either passed to other parts of your configuration, or defined as outputs in your root module. You will see both uses in this guide.
Inside your configuration's directory,
outputs.tf
will need to contain:
outputs.tf
141. How do you pass input variables in the configuration?
You can define
variables.tf
in the root folder
variable "vpc_name"
{
description = "Name of VPC"
type = string
default = "example-vpc"
}
Then you can access these varibles in the configuration like this
module "vpc" {

version = "2.21.0"
name =
var.vpc_name
cidr = var.vpc_cidr
azs = var.vpc_azs

142. What is the child module?
A module that is called by another configuration is sometimes referred to as a "child module" of that configuration.
143. When you use local modules you don’t have to do the command init or get everytime there is a change in the local module. why?
When installing a local module, Terraform will instead refer directly to the source directory.
Because of this, Terraform will automatically notice changes to local modules without having to re-run
terraform init
or
terraform get
.
144. When you use remote modules what should you do if there is a change in themodule?
When installing a remote module, Terraform will download it into the
.terraform
directory in your configuration's root directory.
You should initialize with terraform init
145. A simple configuration consisting of a single directory with one or more .tf filesis a module. Is this true?
True
146. When using a new module for the first time, you must run either
terraforminit
or
terraform get
to install the module. Is this true?
True

147. When installing the modules and where does the terraform save these modules?
.terraform/modules
// Example
.terraform/modules
├── ec2_instances
│ └── terraform-aws-modules-terraform-aws-ec2-instance-ed6dcd9
├── modules.json
└── vpc
└── terraform-aws-modules-terraform-aws-vpc-2417f60
148. What is the required argument for the module?
source
All modules require a
source
argument, which is a meta-argument defined by Terraform CLI. Its value is either the path to a local directory of the module's configuration files, or a remote module source that Terraform should download and use. This value must be a literal string with no template sequences; arbitrary expressions are not allowed. For more information on possible values for this argument, see
Module Sources
.
149. What are the other optional meta-arguments along with the source whendefining modules
version
- (Optional) A
version constraint
string that specifies which versions of the referenced module are acceptable. The newest version matching the constraint will be used.
version
is supported only for modules retrieved from module registries.
providers
- (Optional) A map whose keys are provider configuration names that are expected by child module and whose values are corresponding provider names in the calling module. This allows
provider configurations to be passed explicitly to child modules
. If not specified, the child module inherits all of the default (un-aliased) provider configurations from the calling module.

154. What is the command init?
The
terraform
init
command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.
This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control.
It is safe to run this command multiple times.
155. You recently joined a team and you cloned a terraform configuration files fromthe version control system. What is the first command you should use?
terraform init
This command performs several different initialization steps in order to prepare a working directory for use.
This command is always safe to run multiple times, to bring the working directory up to date with changes in the configuration.
Though subsequent runs may give errors, this command will never delete your existing configuration or state.
If no arguments are given, the configuration in the current working directory is initialized. It is recommended to run Terraform with the current working directory set to the root directory of the configuration, and omit the
DIR
argument.
https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html
156. What is the flag you should use to upgrade modules and plugins a part of theirrespective installation steps?

157. When you are doing initialization with terraform init, you want to skipbackend initialization. What should you do?
terraform init -backend=false
158. When you are doing initialization with terraform init, you want to skip childmodule installation. What should you do?
terraform init -get=false
159. When you are doing initialization where do all the plugins stored?
On most operationg systems : ~/.terraform.d/plugins
on Windows : %APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins
160. When you are doing initialization with terraform init, you want to skip plugininstallation. What should you do?
terraform init -get-plugins=false
Skips plugin installation. Terraform will use plugins installed in the user plugins directory, and any plugins already installed for the current working directory. If the installed plugins aren't sufficient for the configuration, init fails.
161. What does the command terraform validate does?
The
terraform validate
command validates the configuration files in a directory, referring only to the configuration and not accessing any remote services such as remote state, provider APIs, etc.
Validate runs checks that verify whether a configuration is syntactically valid and internally consistent, regardless of any provided variables or existing state.
It is thus primarily useful for general verification of reusable modules, including correctness of attribute names and value types.

162. What does the command plan do?
The
terraform plan
command is used to create an execution plan. Terraform performs a refresh, unless explicitly disabled, and then determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files.
163. What does the command apply do?
The
terraform apply
command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a
terraform plan
execution plan.

164. You are applying the infrastructure with the command apply and you don’twant to do interactive approval. Which flag should you use?
terraform apply -auto-approve
https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html
165. What does the command destroy do?
The
terraform destroy
command is used to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure.
166. How do you preview the behavior of the command terraform destroy?
terraform plan -destroy
167. What are implicit and explicit dependencies?

https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 46/72
Implicit dependency:
By studying the resource attributes used in interpolation expressions, Terraform can automatically infer when one resource depends on another.
Terraform uses this dependency information to determine the correct order in which to create the different resources.
Implicit dependencies via interpolation expressions are the primary way to inform Terraform about these relationships, and should be used whenever possible.
Explicit dependency:
Sometimes there are dependencies between resources that are
not
visible to Terraform. The
depends_on
argument is accepted by any resource and accepts a list of resources to create
explicit dependencies
for.
168. Give an example of implicit dependency?
In the example below, the reference to
aws_instance.example.id
creates an
implicit
dependency
on the
aws_instance
named
example
.
provider "aws" {
profile = "default"
region = "us-east-1"
}
resource "aws_instance" "example"
{
ami = "ami-b374d5a5"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
resource "aws_eip" "ip" {
vpc = true
instance = aws_instance.example.id
}
169. Give an example of explicit dependency?
In the example below, an application we will run on our EC2 instance expects to use a specific Amazon S3 bucket, but that dependency is configured inside the application code and thus not visible to Terraform. In that case, we can use
depends_on
to explicitly declare the dependency

https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/250-practice-questions-for-terraform-associate-certifi cation-7a3ccebe6a1a 47/72
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example"
{
bucket = "some_bucket"
acl = "private"
}
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
ami = "ami-2757f631"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.example]
}
170. How do you save the execution plan?
terraform plan -out=tfplan
you can use that file with apply
terraform apply tfplan
171. You have started writing terraform configuration and you are using somesample configuration as a basis. How do you copy the example configuration intoyour working directory?
terraform init -from-module=MODULE-SOURCE
https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html#copy-a-source-module
172. What is the flag you should use with the terraform plan to get detailed on theexit codes?
terraform plan
-detailed-exitcode
Return a detailed exit code when the command exits. When provided, this argument changes the exit codes and their meanings to provide more granular information about what the resulting plan contains:
* 0 = Succeeded with empty diff (no changes)
* 1 = Error
* 2 = Succeeded with non-empty diff (changes present)

173. How do you target only specific resources when you run a terraform plan?
-target=resource
- A
Resource Address
to target. This flag can be used multiple times. See below for more information.
174. How do you update the state prior to checking differences when you run aterraform plan?
terraform plan -refresh=true
175. The behavior of any
terraform destroy
command can be previewed at any timewith an equivalent
terraform plan -destroy
command. Is this true?
True
176. You have the following file and created two resources docker_image anddocker_container with the command
terraform apply
and you go to the terminaland delete the container with the command
docker rm.
You come back to yourconfiguration and run the command again. Does terraform recreates the resource?

main.tf
Yes. Terrsform creates the resource again since the execution plan says two resources and the terraform always maintains the desired state
177. You created a VM instance on AWS cloud provider with the terraformconfiguration and you log in AWS console and removed the instance. What does thenext apply do?
It creates the instance again
