			simple command

    	21. How do you set the mail address of the root/a user?
		Hint =>
			The system administrator can define email aliases in the file /etc/aliases. This file contains lines
			like root: cwd@mailhost.example.com, /root/mailbox; the effect is the same as having cwd@mailhost.example.com,

			Suspend the current foreground process running in bash. This sends the SIGTSTP signal to the process.
			To return the process to the foreground later, use the fg process_name command.

		Hint =>
			/etc/services contains port number mapping with service name.

    	26. How to redirect STDOUT and STDERR in bash?
