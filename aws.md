   QUESTION NO: 8

       You have an Auto Scaling group associated with an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). You have noticed that instances
       launched via the Auto Scaling group are being marked unhealthy due to an ELB health check, but these unhealthy
       instances are not being terminated. What do you need to do to ensure trial instances marked unhealthy by the 
       ELB will be terminated and replaced?

       A. Change the thresholds set on the Auto Scaling group health check
       B. Add an Elastic Load Balancing health check to your Auto Scaling group
       C. Increase the value for the Health check interval set on the Elastic Load Balancer
       D. Change the health check set on the Elastic Load Balancer to use TCP rather than HTTP checks

       Answer: B

       Reference:
       http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/as-add-elb-healthcheck.html

       Add an Elastic Load Balancing Health Check to your Auto Scaling GroupBy default, an Auto Scaling group
       periodically reviews the results of EC2 instance status to determine the health state of each instance. However,
       if you have associated your Auto Scaling group with an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, you can choose to use
       the Elastic Load Balancing health check. In this case, Auto Scaling determines the health status of your instances
       by checking the results of both the EC2 instance status check and the Elastic Load Balancing instance health check.
       For information about EC2 instance status checks, see Monitor Instances With Status Checks in the Amazon EC2 User 
       Guide for Linux Instances. For information about Elastic Load Balancing health checks, see Health Check in the
       Elastic Load Balancing Developer Guide. This topic shows you how to add an Elastic Load Balancing health check to
       your Auto Scaling group, assuming that you have created a load balancer and have registered the load balancer
       with your Auto Scaling group. If you have not registered the load balancer with your Auto Scaling group, see Set 
       Up a Scaled and Load-Balanced Application. Auto Scaling marks an instance unhealthy if the calls to the Amazon EC2
       action DescribeInstanceStatus return any state other than running, the system status shows impaired, or the calls
       to Elastic Load Balancing action DescribeInstanceHealth returns OutOfService in the instance state field.
       If there are multiple load balancers associated with your Auto Scaling group, Auto Scaling checks the health state
       of your EC2 instances by making health check calls to each load balancer. For each call, if the Elastic Load 
       Balancing action returns any state other than InService, the instance is marked as unhealthy. After Auto Scaling
       marks an instance as unhealthy, it remains in that state, even if subsequent calls from other load balancers return
       an InService state for the same instance.

   QUESTION NO: 19

       You have a Linux EC2 web server instance running inside a VPC The instance is In a public
       subnet and has an EIP associated with it so you can connect to It over the Internet via HTTP or
       SSH The instance was also fully accessible when you last logged in via SSH. and was also
       serving web requests on port 80.
       Now you are not able to SSH into the host nor does it respond to web requests on port 80 that were
       working fine last time you checked You have double-checked that all networking configuration
       parameters (security groups route tables. IGW'EIP. NACLs etc) are properly configured {and you
       haven’t made any changes to those anyway since you were last able to reach the Instance). You
       look at the EC2 console and notice that system status check shows "impaired."
       Which should be your next step in troubleshooting and attempting to get the instance back to a
       healthy state so that you can log in again?

       A. Stop and start the instance so that it will be able to be redeployed on a healthy host system
       that most likely will fix the "impaired" system status
       B. Reboot your instance so that the operating system will have a chance to boot in a clean healthy
       state that most likely will fix the 'impaired" system status
       C. Add another dynamic private IP address to me instance and try to connect via mat new path,
       since the networking stack of the OS may be locked up causing the “impaired” system status.
       D. Add another Elastic Network Interface to the instance and try to connect via that new path
       since the networking stack of the OS may be locked up causing the "impaired" system status
       E. un-map and then re-map the EIP to the instance, since the IGWVNAT gateway may not
       be working properly, causing the "impaired" system status

       to group
       B. The user can create a policy and apply it to multiple users in a single go with the AWS CLI
       C. Add each user to the IAM role as per their organization role to achieve effective policy setup
       D. Use the IAM role and implement access at the role level

       Answer: A

       permissions for a
       collection of users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users. A group
       helps an organization manage access in a better way; instead of applying at the individual level,
       the organization can apply at the group level which is applicable to all the users who are a part
       of that group.

       Which of the
       below mentioned actions is not supported by the CloudWatch alarm?

       A. Notify the Auto Scaling launch config to scale up
       B. Send an SMS using SNS
       C. Notify the Auto Scaling group to scale down
       D. Stop the EC2 instance

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       A user can create a CloudWatch alarm that takes various actions when the alarm changes state.
       An alarm watches a single metric over the time period that the user has specified, and performs
       one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number
       of time periods. The actions could be sending a notification to an Amazon Simple Notification
       Service topic (SMS, Email, and HTTP end point.,notifying the Auto Scaling policy or changing the
       state of the instance to Stop/Terminate.

       A user is trying to delete an Auto Scaling group from CLI. Which of the below mentioned steps are
       to be performed by the user?

       A. Terminate the instances with the ec2-terminate-instance command
       B. Terminate the Auto Scaling instances with the as-terminate-instance command
       C. Set the minimum size and desired capacity to 0
       D. There is no need to change the capacity. Run the as-delete-group command and it will reset
       all values to 0

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       If the user wants to delete the Auto Scaling group, the user should manually set the values of the
       minimum and desired capacity to 0. Otherwise Auto Scaling will not allow for the deletion of the
       group from CLI. While trying from the AWS console, the user need not set the values to 0 as the
       Auto Scaling console will automatically do so.

       to the linked accounts
       D. Each AWS account needs to create an AWS billing policy to provide permission to the
       payee account

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       AWS consolidated billing enables the organization to consolidate payments for multiple Amazon
       Web Services (AWS. accounts within a single organization by making a single paying account.
       Consolidated billing enables the organization to see a combined view of the AWS charges
       incurred by each account as well as obtain a detailed cost report for each of the individual AWS
       accounts associated with the paying account. The payee account will not have any other
       access than billing data of linked accounts.

       service in AWS used by the user, as well as the estimated overall AWS charges. If the user
       wants to increase the limit, the user can modify the alarm and specify a new threshold.

   QUESTION NO: 68

       A sys admin has created the below mentioned policy and applied to an S3 object named aws.jpg.
       The aws.jpg is inside a bucket named cloudacademy. What does this policy define?
       "Statement": [{
       "Sid": "Stmt1388811069831",
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": { "AWS": "*"},
       "Action": [ "s3:GetObjectAcl", "s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetObject"],
       "Resource": [ "arn:aws:s3:::cloudacademy/*.jpg"]
       }]

       A. It is not possible to define a policy at the object level
       B. It will make all the objects of the bucket cloudacademy as public
       C. It will make the bucket cloudacademy as public
       D. the aws.jpg object as public

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       A system admin can grant permission to the S3 objects or buckets to any user or make objects
       public using the bucket policy and user policy. Both use the JSON-based access policy
       language. Generally if the user is defining the ACL on the bucket, the objects in the bucket do not
       inherit it and vice a versa. The bucket policy can be defined at the bucket level which allows the
       objects as well as the bucket to be public with a single policy applied to that bucket. It cannot be
       applied at the object level.

       A user is trying to save some cost on the AWS services. Which of the below mentioned options
       will not help him save cost?
       A. Delete the unutilized EBS volumes once the instance is terminated
       B. Delete the AutoScaling launch configuration after the instances are terminated
       C. Release the elastic IP if not required once the instance is terminated
       D. Delete the AWS ELB after the instances are terminated

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       AWS bills the user on a as pay as you go model. AWS will charge the user once the AWS
       resource is allocated. Even though the user is not using the resource, AWS will charge if it is in service or
       allocated. Thus, it is advised that once the user’s work is completed he should: Terminate the EC2 
       instance Delete the EBS volumes Release the unutilized Elastic IPs Delete ELB The AutoScaling launch
       configuration does not cost the user. Thus, it will not make any difference to the cost whether it is 
       deleted or not.

       A. Programmatic access
       B. AWS bucket to hold the billing report
       C. AWS billing alerts
       D. Monthly Billing report

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       AWS provides an option to have programmatic access to billing. Programmatic Billing Access
       leverages the existing Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3. APIs. Thus, the user can
       build applications that reference his billing data from a CSV (comma-separated value. file stored
       in an Amazon S3 bucket. To enable programmatic access, the user has to first enable the
       monthly billing report. Then the user needs to provide an AWS bucket name where the billing
       CSV will be uploaded. The user should also enable the Programmatic access option.

       You are building an online store on AWS that uses SQS to process your customer orders. Your backend
       system needs those messages in the same sequence the customer orders have been put in. How can you achieve that?

       A. It is not possible to do this with SQS
       B. You can use sequencing information on each message
       C. You can do this with SQS but you also need to use SWF
       D. Messages will arrive in the same order by default

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       Amazon SQS is engineered to always be available and deliver messages. One of the resulting
       tradeoffs is that SQSdoes not guarantee first in, first out delivery of messages. For many
       distributed applications, each message can stand on its own, and as long as all messages are
       delivered, the order is not important. If your system requires that order be preserved, you can
       place sequencing information in each message, so that you can reorder the messages when
       the queue returns them.

       A system admin is managing buckets, objects and folders with AWS S3. Which of the below mentioned
       statements is true and should be taken in consideration by the sysadmin?

       A. The folders support only ACL
       B. Both the object and bucket can have an Access Policy but folder cannot have policy
       C. Folders can have a policy
       D. Both the object and bucket can have ACL but folders cannot have ACL

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       A sysadmin can grant permission to the S3 objects or the buckets to any user or make objects
       public using the bucket policy and user policy. Both use the JSON-based access policy
       language. Generally if user is defining the ACL on the bucket, the objects in the bucket do not
       inherit it and vice a versa. The bucket policy can be defined at the bucket level which allows the
       objects as well as the bucket to be public with a single policy applied to that bucket. It cannot be
       applied at the object level. The folders are similar to objects with no content. Thus, folders can
       have only ACL and cannot have a policy.

       Explanation:
       Elastic Load Balancing provides a special Amazon EC2 source security group that the user can
       use to ensure that back-end EC2 instances receive traffic only from Elastic Load Balancing. This
       feature needs two security groups: the source security group and a security group that defines
       the ingress rules for the back-end instances. To ensure that traffic only flows between the load
       balancer and the back-end instances, the user can add or modify a rule to the back-end security
       group which can limit the ingress traffic. Thus, it can come only from the source security group
       provided by Elastic load Balancing.

       An organization has created 50 IAM users. The organization wants that each user can change
       their password but cannot change their access keys. How can the organization achieve this?

       A. The organization has to create a special password policy and attach it to each user
       B. The root account owner has to use CLI which forces each IAM user to change their password on 
          first login
       C. By default each IAM user can modify their passwords
       D. The root account owner can set the policy from the IAM console under the password policy screen

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       With AWS IAM, organizations can use the AWS Management Console to display, create, change
       or delete a password policy. As a part of managing the password policy, the user can enable all
       users to manage their own passwords. If the user has selected the option which allows the IAM
       users to modify their password, he does not need to set a separate policy for the users. This
       option in the AWS console allows changing only the password.

       A user has created a photo editing software and hosted it on EC2. The software accepts
       requests from the user about the photo format and resolution and sends a message to S3 to
       enhance the picture accordingly.Which of the below mentioned AWS services will help make a
       scalable software with the AWS infrastructure in this scenario?

       A. AWS Glacier
       B. AWS Elastic Transcoder
       C. AWS Simple Notification Service
       D. AWS Simple Queue Service

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS. is a fast, reliable, scalable, and fully managed message
       queuing service. SQS provides a simple and cost-effective way to decouple the components of
       an application. The user can configure SQS, which will decouple the call between the EC2
       application and S3. Thus, the application does not keep waiting for S3 to provide the data.

   QUESTION NO: 89

       An application is generating a log file every 5 minutes. The log file is not critical but may be
       required only for verification in case of some major issue. The file should be accessible over the
       internet whenever required. Which of the below mentioned options is a best possible storage
       solution for it?

       A. AWS S3
       B. AWS Glacier
       C. AWS RDS
       D. AWS RRS

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       Amazon S3 stores objects according to their storage class. There are three major storage
       classes: Standard, Reduced Redundancy Storage and Glacier. Standard is for AWS S3 and
       provides very high durability. However, the costs are a little higher. Glacier is for archival and the
       files are not available over the internet. Reduced Redundancy Storage is for less critical files.
       Reduced Redundancy is little cheaper as it provides less durability in comparison to S3. In this
       case since the log files are not mission critical files, RRS will be a better option.

       A user has created a VPC with CIDR 20.0.0.0/24. The user has created a public subnet with
       CIDR 20.0.0.0/25. The user is trying to create the private subnet with CIDR 20.0.0.128/25. Which
       of the below mentioned statements is true in this scenario?

       A. It will not allow the user to create the private subnet due to a CIDR overlap
       B. It will allow the user to create a private subnet with CIDR as 20.0.0.128/25
       C. This statement is wrong as AWS does not allow CIDR 20.0.0.0/25
       D. It will not allow the user to create a private subnet due to a wrong CIDR range

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       When the user creates a subnet in VPC, he specifies the CIDR block for the subnet. The CIDR
       block of a subnet can be the same as the CIDR block for the VPC (for a single subnet in the
       VPC., or a subset (to enable multiple subnets.. If the user creates more than one subnet in a
       VPC, the CIDR blocks of the subnets must not overlap. Thus, in this case the user has created a
       VPC with the CIDR block 20.0.0.0/24, which supports 256 IP addresses (20.0.0.0 to 20.0.0.255..
       The user can break this CIDR block into two subnets, each supporting 128 IP addresses. One
       subnet uses the CIDR block 20.0.0.0/25 (for addresses 20.0.0.0 - 20.0.0.127. and the other uses
       the CIDR block 20.0.0.128/25 (for addresses 20.0.0.128 - 20.0.0.255..

   QUESTION NO: 91

       A user has created an S3 bucket which is not publicly accessible. The bucket is having thirty
       objects which are also private. If the user wants to make the objects public, how can he configure
       this with minimal efforts?

       A. The user should select all objects from the console and apply a single policy to mark
          them public
       B. The user can write a program which programmatically makes all objects public using S3 SDK
       C. Set the AWS bucket policy which marks all objects as public
       D. Make the bucket ACL as public so it will also mark all objects as public

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       A system admin can grant permission of the S3 objects or buckets to any user or make the
       objects public using the bucket policy and user policy. Both use the JSON-based access policy
       language. Generally if the user is defining the ACL on the bucket, the objects in the bucket do not
       inherit it and vice a versa. The bucket policy can be defined at the bucket level which allows the
       objects as well as the bucket to be public with a single policy applied to that bucket.

   QUESTION NO: 92

       A sys admin is maintaining an application on AWS. The application is installed on EC2 and user
       has configured ELB and Auto Scaling. Considering future load increase, the user is planning to
       launch new servers proactively so that they get registered with ELB. How can the user add these
       instances with Auto Scaling?

       A. Increase the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group
       B. Increase the maximum limit of the Auto Scaling group
       C. Launch an instance manually and register it with ELB on the fly
       D. Decrease the minimum limit of the Auto Scaling grou

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       A user can increase the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group and Auto Scaling will launch a
       new instance as per the new capacity. The newly launched instances will be registered with ELB if
       Auto Scaling group is configured with ELB. If the user decreases the minimum size the instances
       will be removed from Auto Scaling. Increasing the maximum size will not add instances but only
       set the maximum instance cap.

       An organization, which has the AWS account ID as 999988887777, has created 50 IAM users. All
       the users are added to the same group cloudacademy. If the organization has enabled that each
       IAM user can login with the AWS console, which AWS login URL will the IAM users use?

       A. https:// 999988887777.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/
       B. https:// signin.aws.amazon.com/cloudacademy/
       C. https:// cloudacademy.signin.aws.amazon.com/999988887777/console/
       D. https:// 999988887777.aws.amazon.com/ cloudacademy/

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       AWS Identity and Access Management is a web service which allows organizations to manage
       users and user permissions for various AWS services. Once the organization has created the IAM
       users, they will have a separate AWS console URL to login to the AWS console. The console login
       URL for the IAM user will be https:// AWS_Account_ID.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/. It uses
       only the AWS account ID and does not depend on the group or user ID.

   QUESTION NO: 94

       A user has setup connection draining with ELB to allow in-flight requests to continue while the
       instance is being deregistered through Auto Scaling. If the user has not specified the draining
       time, how long will ELB allow inflight requests traffic to continue?

       A. 600 seconds
       B. 3600 seconds
       C. 300 seconds
       D. 0 seconds

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       The Elastic Load Balancer connection draining feature causes the load balancer to stop sending
       new requests to the back-end instances when the instances are deregistering or become unhealthy,
       while ensuring that inflight requests continue to be served. The user can specify a maximum time
       (3600 seconds. for the load balancer to keep the connections alive before reporting the instance as
       deregistered. If the user does not specify the maximum timeout period, by default, the load balancer
       will close the connections to the deregistering instance after 300 seconds.

   QUESTION NO: 95

       A root AWS account owner is trying to understand various options to set the permission to AWS
       S3. Which of the below mentioned options is not the right option to grant permission for S3?

       A. User Access Policy
       B. S3 Object Access Policy
       C. S3 Bucket Access Policy
       D. S3 ACL

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       Amazon S3 provides a set of operations to work with the Amazon S3 resources. Managing S3
       resource access refers to granting others permissions to work with S3. There are three ways
       the root account owner can define access with S3:
       S3 ACL: The user can use ACLs to grant basic read/write permissions to other AWS accounts.
       S3 Bucket Policy: The policy is used to grant other AWS accounts or IAM users permissions for
       the bucket and the objects in it.
       User Access Policy: Define an IAM user and assign him the IAM policy which grants him access to S3.

   QUESTION NO: 96

       A sys admin has created a shopping cart application and hosted it on EC2. The EC2 instances
       are running behind ELB. The admin wants to ensure that the end user request will always go to
       the EC2 instance where the user session has been created. How can the admin configure this?

       A. Enable ELB cross zone load balancing
       B. Enable ELB cookie setup
       C. Enable ELB sticky session
       D. Enable ELB connection draining

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       Generally AWS ELB routes each request to a zone with the minimum load. The Elastic Load
       Balancer provides a feature called sticky session which binds the user’s session with a specific
       EC2 instance. If the sticky session is enabled the first request from the user will be redirected to
       any of the EC2 instances. But, henceforth, all requests from the same user will be redirected to
       the same EC2 instance. This ensures that all requests coming from the user during the session
       will be sent to the same application instance.

   QUESTION NO: 97

       A user has configured ELB with three instances. The user wants to achieve High Availabilityi as well
       as redundancy with ELB. Which of the below mentioned AWS services helps the user achieve this for
       ELB?

       A. Route 53
       B. AWS Mechanical Turk
       C. Auto Scaling
       D. AWS EMR

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       The user can provide high availability and redundancy for applications running behind Elastic
       Load Balancer by enabling the Amazon Route 53 Domain Name System (DNS. failover for the
       load balancers. Amazon Route 53 is a DNS service that provides reliable routing to the user’s
       infrastructure.

       An organization is using AWS since a few months. The finance team wants to visualize the pattern
       of AWS spending. Which of the below AWS tool will help for this requirement?

       A. AWS Cost Manager
       B. AWS Cost Explorer
       C. AWS CloudWatch
       D. AWS Consolidated Billing

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       The AWS Billing and Cost Management console includes the Cost Explorer tool for viewing AWS
       cost data as a graph. It does not charge extra to user for this service. With Cost Explorer the user
       can filter graphs using resource tags or with services in AWS. If the organization is using
       Consolidated Billing it helps generate report based on linked accounts. This will help organization
       to identify areas that require further inquiry. The organization can view trends and use that to
       understand spend and to predict future costs.

       mistake. What will happen to the instances?

       A. ELB will ask the user whether to delete the instances or not
       B. Instances will be terminated
       C. ELB cannot be deleted if it has running instances registered with it
       D. Instances will keep running

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       When the user deletes the Elastic Load Balancer, all the registered instances will be deregistered.
       However, they will continue to run. The user will incur charges if he does not take any action on
       those instances.

       A customer is using AWS for Dev and Test. The customer wants to setup the Dev environment
       with Cloudformation. Which of the below mentioned steps are not required while using Cloudformation?

       A. Create a stack
       B. Configure a service
       C. Create and upload the template
       D. Provide the parameters configured as part of the template

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       AWS Cloudformation is an application management tool which provides application modelling,
       deployment, configuration, management and related activities. AWS CloudFormation introduces
       two concepts: the template and the stack. The template is a JSON-format, text-based file that
       describes all the AWS resources required to deploy and run an application. The stack is a
       collection of AWS resources which are created and managed as a single unit when AWS
       CloudFormation instantiates a template. While creating a stack, the user uploads the template
       and provides the data for the parameters if required.

       A user has configured the AWS CloudWatch alarm for estimated usage charges in the US East
       region. Which of the below mentioned statements is not true with respect to the estimated
       charges?

       A. It will store the estimated charges data of the last 14 days
       B. It will include the estimated charges of every AWS service
       C. The metric data will represent the data of all the regions
       D. The metric data will show data specific to that region

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       When the user has enabled the monitoring of estimated charges for the AWS account with AWS
       CloudWatch, the estimated charges are calculated and sent several times daily to CloudWatch in
       the form of metric data. This data will be stored for 14 days. The billing metric data is stored in the
       US East (Northern Virginia. Region and represents worldwide charges. This data also includes
       the estimated charges for every service in AWS used by the user, as well as the estimated overall
       AWS charges.

   QUESTION NO: 103

       A user is accessing RDS from an application. The user has enabled the Multi AZ feature with the
       MS SQL RDS DB. During a planned outage how will AWS ensure that a switch from DB to a standby replica
       will not affect access to the application?

       A. RDS will have an internal IP which will redirect all requests to the new DB
       B. RDS uses DNS to switch over to stand by replica for seamless transition
       C. The switch over changes Hardware so RDS does not need to worry about access
       D. RDS will have both the DBs running independently and the user has to manually switch over

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       In the event of a planned or unplanned outage of a DB instance, Amazon RDS automatically
       switches to a standby replica in another Availability Zone if the user has enabled Multi AZ. The
       automatic failover mechanism simply changes the DNS record of the DB instance to point to the
       standby DB instance. As a result, the user will need to re-establish any existing connections to
       the DB instance. However, as the DNS is the same, the application can access DB seamlessly.

       An organization is generating digital policy files which are required by the admins for verification.
       Once the files are verified they may not be required in the future unless there is some compliance
       issue. If the organization wants to save them in a cost effective way, which is the best possible
       solution?

       A. AWS RRS
       B. AWS S3
       C. AWS RDS
       D. AWS Glacier

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       Amazon S3 stores objects according to their storage class. There are three major storage classes:
       Standard, Reduced Redundancy and Glacier. Standard is for AWS S3 and provides very high
       durability. However, the costs are a little higher. Reduced redundancy is for less critical files.
       Glacier is for archival and the files which are accessed infrequently. It is an extremely low-cost
       storage service that provides secure and durable storage for data archiving and backup.

   QUESTION NO: 105

       A user has launched an EBS backed instance. The user started the instance at 9 AM in the
       morning. Between 9 AM to 10 AM, the user is testing some script. Thus, he stopped the instance
       twice and restarted it. In the same hour the user rebooted the instance once. For how many
       instance hours will AWS charge the user?

       A. 3 hours
       B. 4 hours
       C. 2 hours
       D. 1 hour

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       A user can stop/start or reboot an EC2 instance using the AWS console, the Amazon EC2 CLI or
       the Amazon EC2 API. Rebooting an instance is equivalent to rebooting an operating system.
       When the instance is rebooted AWS will not charge the user for the extra hours. In case the user
       stops the instance, AWS does not charge the running cost but charges only the EBS storage
       cost. If the user starts and stops the instance multiple times in a single hour, AWS will charge the
       user for every start and stop. In this case, since the instance was rebooted twice, it will cost the
       user for 3 instance hours.

   QUESTION NO: 106

       An organization has configured the custom metric upload with CloudWatch. The organization has
       given permission to its employees to upload data using CLI as well SDK. How can the user track
       the calls made to CloudWatch?

       A. The user can enable logging with CloudWatch which logs all the activities
       B. Use CloudTrail to monitor the API calls
       C. Create an IAM user and allow each user to log the data using the S3 bucket
       D. Enable detailed monitoring with CloudWatch

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       AWS CloudTrail is a web service which will allow the user to monitor the calls made to the
       Amazon CloudWatch API for the organization’s account, including calls made by the AWS
       Management Console, Command Line Interface (CLI., and other services. When CloudTrail
       logging is turned on, CloudWatch will write log files into the Amazon S3 bucket, which is specified
       during the CloudTrail configuration.

       A user has created a queue named “myqueue” with SQS. There are four messages published to
       queue which are not received by the consumer yet. If the user tries to delete the queue, what will
       happen?

       A. A user can never delete a queue manually. AWS deletes it after 30 days of inactivity on queue
       B. It will delete the queue
       C. It will initiate the delete but wait for four days before deleting until all messages are
          deleted automatically.
       D. It will ask user to delete the messages first
 
       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       SQS allows the user to move data between distributed components of applications so they can
       perform different tasks without losing messages or requiring each component to be always
       available. The user can delete a queue at any time, whether it is empty or not. It is important to
       note that queues retain messages for a set period of time. By default, a queue retains messages
       for four days.

       to achieve Disaster Recovery (DR. for that instance by creating another small instance in Europe.
       How can the user achieve DR?

       A. Copy the running instance using the “Instance Copy” command to the EU region
       B. Create AMI of the instance and copy the AMI to the EU region. Then launch the instance from the EU AMI.
       C. Copy the instance from the US East region to the EU region
       D. Use the “Launch more like this” option to copy the instance from one region to another

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       To launch an EC2 instance it is required to have an AMI in that region. If the AMI is not available
       in that region, then create a new AMI or use the copy command to copy the AMI from one region
       to the other region.

       A user has created numerous EBS volumes. What is the general limit for each AWS account for
       the maximum number of EBS volumes that can be created?

       A. 10000
       B. 5000
       C. 100
       D. 1000

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       A user can attach multiple EBS volumes to the same instance within the limits specified by his
       AWS account. Each AWS account has a limit on the number of Amazon EBS volumes that the
       user can create, and the total storage available. The default limit for the maximum number of
       volumes that can be created is 5000.

       A user has created a VPC with CIDR 20.0.0.0/16 using the wizard. The user has created a public
       subnet CIDR (20.0.0.0/24. and VPN only subnets CIDR (20.0.1.0/24. along with the VPN
       gateway (vgw-12345. to connect to the user’s data centre. Which of the below mentioned options
       is a valid entry for the main route table in this scenario?

       A. Destination: 20.0.0.0/24 and Target: vgw-12345
       B. Destination: 20.0.0.0/16 and Target: ALL
       C. Destination: 20.0.1.0/16 and Target: vgw-12345
       D. Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 and Target: vgw-12345

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       The user can create subnets as per the requirement within a VPC. If the user wants to connect
       VPC from his own data centre, he can setup a public and VPN only subnet which uses hardware
       VPN access to connect with his data centre. When the user has configured this setup with
       Wizard, it will create a virtual private gateway to route all traffic of the VPN subnet. Here are the
       valid entries for the main route table in this scenario: Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 & Target: vgw-12345
       (To route all internet traffic to the VPN gateway.
       Destination: 20.0.0.0/16 & Target: local (To allow local routing in VPC.

       friend’s AWS account. How can user achieve this?

       A. Create an AMI from the volume and share the AMI
       B. Copy the data to an unencrypted volume and then share
       C. Take a snapshot and share the snapshot with a friend
       D. If both the accounts are using the same encryption key then the user can share the
       volume directly

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       AWS EBS supports encryption of the volume. It also supports creating volumes from existing
       snapshots provided the snapshots are created from encrypted volumes. If the user is having data on an
       encrypted volume and is trying to share it with others, he has to copy the data from the encrypted
       volume to a new unencrypted volume. Only then can the user share it as an encrypted volume
       data. Otherwise the snapshot cannot be shared.

       A user has enabled the Multi AZ feature with the MS SQL RDS database server. Which of the
       below mentioned statements will help the user understand the Multi AZ feature better?

       A. In a Multi AZ, AWS runs two DBs in parallel and copies the data asynchronously to the
          replica copy
       B. In a Multi AZ, AWS runs two DBs in parallel and copies the data synchronously to the replica
          copy
       C. In a Multi AZ, AWS runs just one DB but copies the data synchronously to the standby replica
       D. AWS MS SQL does not support the Multi AZ feature

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       Amazon RDS provides high availability and failover support for DB instances using Multi-AZ
       deployments. In a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a
       synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone. The primary DB instance is
       synchronously replicated across Availability Zones to a standby replica to provide data
       redundancy, eliminate I/O freezes, and minimize latency spikes during system backups. Running
       a DB instance with high availability can enhance availability during planned system maintenance,
       and help protect your databases against DB instance failure and Availability Zone disruption.Note
       that the high-availability feature is not a scaling solution for read-only scenarios; you cannot use a
       standby replica to serve read traffic. To service read-only traffic, you should use a read replica.

       An organization is using cost allocation tags to find the cost distribution of different departments
       and projects. One of the instances has two separate tags with the key/ value as “InstanceName/
       HR”, “CostCenter/HR”. What will AWS do in this case?

       A. InstanceName is a reserved tag for AWS. Thus, AWS will not allow this tag
       B. AWS will not allow the tags as the value is the same for different keys
       C. AWS will allow tags but will not show correctly in the cost allocation report due to the
          same value of the two separate keys
       D. AWS will allow both the tags and show properly in the cost distribution report

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       AWS provides cost allocation tags to categorize and track the AWS costs. When the user applies
       tags to his AWS resources, AWS generates a cost allocation report as a comma-separated value
       (CSV file. with the usage and costs aggregated by those tags. Each tag will have a key-value and
       can be applied to services, such as EC2, S3, RDS, EMR, etc. It is required that the key should be
       different for each tag. The value can be the same for different keys. In this case since the value is
       different, AWS will properly show the distribution report with the correct values.

   QUESTION NO: 114

       A user is publishing custom metrics to CloudWatch. Which of the below mentioned statements will
       help the user understand the functionality better?

       A. The user can use the CloudWatch Import tool
       B. The user should be able to see the data in the console after around 15 minutes
       C. If the user is uploading the custom data, the user must supply the namespace, timezone,
          and metric name as part of the command
       D. The user can view as well as upload data using the console, CLI and APIs

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       AWS CloudWatch supports the custom metrics. The user can always capture the custom data and
       upload the data to CloudWatch using CLI or APIs. The user has to always include the
       namespace as a part of the request. However, the other parameters are optional. If the user has
       uploaded data using CLI, he can view it as a graph inside the console. The data will take around
       2 minutes to upload but can be viewed only after around 15 minutes.

       A user is launching an EC2 instance in the US East region. Which of the below mentioned options
       is recommended by AWS with respect to the selection of the availability zone?

       A. Always select the US-East-1-a zone for HA
       B. Do not select the AZ; instead let AWS select the AZ
       C. The user can never select the availability zone while launching an instance
       D. Always select the AZ while launching an instance

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       When launching an instance with EC2, AWS recommends not to select the availability zone
       (AZ.. AWS specifies that the default Availability Zone should be accepted. This is because it 
       enables AWS to select the best Availability Zone based on the system health and available capacity. 
       If the user launches additional instances, only then an Availability Zone should be specified. 
       This is to specify the same or different AZ from the running instances.

       A user has created a VPC with CIDR 20.0.0.0/16 with only a private subnet and VPN connection
       using the VPC wizard. The user wants to connect to the instance in a private subnet over SSH.
       How should the user define the security rule for SSH?

       A. Allow Inbound traffic on port 22 from the user’s network
       B. The user has to create an instance in EC2 Classic with an elastic IP and configure the security
          group of a private subnet to allow SSH from that elastic IP
       C. The user can connect to a instance in a private subnet using the NAT instance
       D. Allow Inbound traffic on port 80 and 22 to allow the user to connect to a private subnet over the
          Internet

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       The user can create subnets as per the requirement within a VPC. If the user wants to connect
       VPC from his own data centre, the user can setup a case with a VPN only subnet (private. which
       uses VPN access to connect with his data centre. When the user has configured this setup with
       Wizard, all network connections to the instances in the subnet will come from his data centre. The
       user has to configure the security group of the private subnet which allows the inbound traffic on
       SSH (port 22. from the data centre’s network range.

       zones to ELB to achieve High Availability. How can the user add more zones to the existing ELB?

       A. It is not possible to add more zones to the existing ELB
       B. The only option is to launch instances in different zones and add to ELB
       C. The user should stop the ELB and add zones and instances as required
       D. The user can add zones on the fly from the AWS console

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       The user has created an Elastic Load Balancer with the availability zone and wants to add more
       zones to the existing ELB. The user can do so in two ways:
       From the console or CLI, add new zones to ELB;
       Launch instances in a separate AZ and add instances to the existing ELB.

   QUESTION NO: 118

       A user has configured an Auto Scaling group with ELB. The user has enabled detailed
       CloudWatch monitoring on Elastic Load balancing. Which of the below mentioned statements
       will help the user understand this functionality better?

       A. ELB sends data to CloudWatch every minute only and does not charge the user
       B. ELB will send data every minute and will charge the user extra
       C. ELB is not supported by CloudWatch
       D. It is not possible to setup detailed monitoring for ELB

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS as well as the custom services. It provides either basic or
       detailed monitoring for the supported AWS products. In basic monitoring, a service sends data points
       to CloudWatch every five minutes, while in detailed monitoring a service sends data points to
       CloudWatch every minute. Elastic Load Balancing includes 10 metrics and 2 dimensions, and
       sends data to CloudWatch every minute. This does not cost extra.

   QUESTION NO: 119

       A user has configured ELB with two EBS backed EC2 instances. The user is trying to
       understand the DNS access and IP support for ELB. Which of the below mentioned statements
       may not help the user understand the IP mechanism supported by ELB?

       A. The client can connect over IPV4 or IPV6 using Dualstack
       B. ELB DNS supports both IPV4 and IPV6
       C. Communication between the load balancer and back-end instances is always through IPV4
       D. The ELB supports either IPV4 or IPV6 but not both

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       Elastic Load Balancing supports both Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6. and Internet Protocol
       version 4 (IPv4.. Clients can connect to the user’s load balancer using either IPv4 or IPv6 (in EC2-
       Classic. DNS. However, communication between the load balancer and its back-end instances
       uses only IPv4. The user can use the Dualstack-prefixed DNS name to enable IPv6 support for
       communications between the client and the load balancers. Thus, the clients are able to access
       the load balancer using either IPv4 or IPv6 as their individual connectivity needs dictate.

   QUESTION NO: 120

       A user has received a message from the support team that an issue occurred 1 week back
       between 3 AM to 4 AM and the EC2 server was not reachable. The user is checking the
       CloudWatch metrics of that instance. How can the user find the data easily using the CloudWatch
       console?

       A. The user can find the data by giving the exact values in the time Tab under CloudWatch metrics
       B. The user can find the data by filtering values of the last 1 week for a 1 hour period in
          the Relative tab under CloudWatch metrics
       C. It is not possible to find the exact time from the console. The user has to use CLI to provide the
          specific time
       D. The user can find the data by giving the exact values in the Absolute tab under
           CloudWatch metrics

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       If the user is viewing the data inside the CloudWatch console, the console provides options to filter
       values either using the relative period, such as days /hours or using the Absolute tab where the user
       can provide data with a specific date and time. The console also provides the option to search using
       the local timezone under the time range caption in the console.

   QUESTION NO: 121

       A user has setup Auto Scaling with ELB on the EC2 instances. The user wants to configure that
       whenever the CPU utilization is below 10%, Auto Scaling should remove one instance. How can
       the user configure this?

       A. The user can get an email using SNS when the CPU utilization is less than 10%. The user can
          use the desired capacity of Auto Scaling to remove the instance
       B. Use CloudWatch to monitor the data and Auto Scaling to remove the instances
          using scheduled actions
       C. Configure CloudWatch to send a notification to Auto Scaling Launch configuration when the CPU
          utilization is less than 10% and configure the Auto Scaling policy to remove the instance
       D. Configure CloudWatch to send a notification to the Auto Scaling group when the CPU Utilization
          is less than 10% and configure the Auto Scaling policy to remove the instance

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       Amazon CloudWatch alarms watch a single metric over a time period that the user specifies and
       performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over
       a number of time periods. The user can setup to receive a notification on the Auto Scaling group
       with the CloudWatch alarm when the CPU utilization is below a certain threshold. The user can
       configure the Auto Scaling policy to take action for removing the instance. When the CPU
       utilization is below 10% CloudWatch will send an alarm to the Auto Scaling group to execute the
       policy.

   QUESTION NO: 122

       A user has enabled detailed CloudWatch metric monitoring on an Auto Scaling group. Which of
       the below mentioned metrics will help the user identify the total number of instances in an Auto
       Scaling group cluding pending, terminating and running instances?

       A. GroupTotalInstances
       B. GroupSumInstances
       C. It is not possible to get a count of all the three metrics together. The user has to find
          the individual number of running, terminating and pending instances and sum it
       D. GroupInstancesCount

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS as well as the custom services. For Auto Scaling,
       CloudWatch provides various metrics to get the group information, such as the Number of
       Pending, Running or Terminating instances at any moment. If the user wants to get the total
       number of Running, Pending and Terminating instances at any moment, he can use the
       GroupTotalInstances metric.

       A user is trying to configure the CloudWatch billing alarm. Which of the below mentioned steps
       should be performed by the user for the first time alarm creation in the AWS Account Management 
       section?

       A. Enable Receiving Billing Reports
       B. Enable Receiving Billing Alerts
       C. Enable AWS billing utility
       D. Enable CloudWatch Billing Threshold

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       AWS CloudWatch supports enabling the billing alarm on the total AWS charges. Before the user
       can create an alarm on the estimated charges, he must enable monitoring of the estimated AWS
       charges, by selecting the option “Enable receiving billing alerts”. It takes about 15 minutes
       before the user can view the billing data. The user can then create the alarms.

       A user is checking the CloudWatch metrics from the AWS console. The user notices that the
       CloudWatch data is coming in UTC. The user wants to convert the data to a local time zone. How
       can the user perform this?

       A. In the CloudWatch dashboard the user should set the local timezone so that CloudWatch
          shows the data only in the local time zone
       B. In the CloudWatch console select the local timezone under the Time Range tab to 712
          view the data as per the local timezone
       C. The CloudWatch data is always in UTC; the user has to manually convert the data
       D. The user should have send the local timezone while uploading the data so that CloudWatch will
          show the data only in the local timezone

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       If the user is viewing the data inside the CloudWatch console, the console provides options to filter
       values either using the relative period, such as days/hours or using the Absolute tab where the use
       can provide data with a specific date and time. The console also provides the option to search using
       the local timezone under the time range caption in the console because the time range tab allows
       the user to change the time zone.

   QUESTION NO: 128

       A user has configured CloudWatch monitoring on an EBS backed EC2 instance. If the user has
       not attached any additional device, which of the below mentioned metrics will always show a 0
       value?

       A. DiskReadBytes 7456
       B. NetworkIn
       C. NetworkOut
       D. CPUUtilization

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS as the well custom services. For EC2 when the user is
       monitoring the EC2 instances, it will capture the 7 Instance level and 3 system check parameters
       for the EC2 instance. Since this is an EBS backed instance, it will not have ephermal storage
       attached to it. Out of the 7 EC2 metrics, the 4 metrics DiskReadOps, DiskWriteOps,
       DiskReadBytes and DiskWriteBytes are disk related data and available only when there is
       ephermal storage attached to an instance. For an EBS backed instance without any additional
       device, this data will be 0.

   QUESTION NO: 129

       A user has launched an EBS backed EC2 instance. What will be the difference while performing
       the restart or stop/start options on that instance?

       A. For restart it does not charge for an extra hour, while every stop/start it will be charged as
          a separate hour
       B. Every restart is charged by AWS as a separate hour, while multiple start/stop actions during
          a single hour will be counted as a single hour
       C. For every restart or start/stop it will be charged as a separate hour
       D. For restart it charges extra only once, while for every stop/start it will be charged as a
          separate hour

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       For an EC2 instance launched with an EBS backed AMI, each time the instance state is
       changed from stop to start/ running, AWS charges a full instance hour, even if these transitions
       happen multiple times within a single hour. Anyway, rebooting an instance AWS does not charge
       a new instance billing hour.

   QUESTION NO: 130

       A user has created a queue named “myqueue” in US-East region with AWS SQS. The user’s
       AWS account ID is 123456789012. If the user wants to perform some action on this queue, which
       of the below Queue URL should he use?

       A. http://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/myqueue
       B. http://sqs.amazonaws.com/123456789012/myqueue
       C. http://sqs. 123456789012.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/myqueue
       D. http:// 123456789012.sqs. us-east-1.amazonaws.com/myqueue

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       When creating a new queue in SQS, the user must provide a queue name that is unique within
       the scope of all queues of user’s account. If the user creates queues using both the latest WSDL
       and a previous version, he will have a single namespace for all his queues. Amazon SQS assigns
       each queue created by user an identifier called a queue URL, which includes the queue name
       and other components that Amazon SQS determines. Whenever the user wants to perform an
       action on a queue, he must provide its queue URL. The queue URL for the account id
       123456789012 & queue name “myqueue” in US-East-1 region will be http:// sqs.us-east1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/myqueue.

       A sys admin is trying to understand EBS snapshots. Which of the below mentioned statements will
       not be useful to the admin to understand the concepts about a snapshot?

       A. The snapshot is synchronous
       B. It is recommended to stop the instance before taking a snapshot for consistent data
       C. The snapshot is incremental
       D. The snapshot captures the data that has been written to the hard disk when the
          snapshot command was executed

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       The AWS snapshot is a point in time backup of an EBS volume. When the snapshot command is
       executed it will capture the current state of the data that is written on the drive and take a backup.
       For a better and consistent snapshot of the root EBS volume, AWS recommends stopping the
       instance. For additional volumes it is recommended to unmount the device. The snapshots are
       asynchronous and incremental.

       A root account owner has created an S3 bucket testmycloud. The account owner wants to allow
       everyone to upload the objects as well as enforce that the person who uploaded the object
       should manage the permission of those objects. Which is the easiest way to achieve this?

       A. The root account owner should create a bucket policy which allows the IAM users to upload the
          object
       B. The root account owner should create the bucket policy which allows the other account owners
          to set the object policy of that bucket
       C. The root account should use ACL with the bucket to allow everyone to upload the object
       D. The root account should create the IAM users and provide them the permission to upload content
           to the bucket

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       Each AWS S3 bucket and object has an ACL (Access Control List. associated with it. An ACL is a
       list of grants identifying the grantee and the permission granted. The user can use ACLs to grant
       basic read/write permissions to other AWS accounts. ACLs use an Amazon S3–specific XML
       schema. The user cannot grant permissions to other users in his account. ACLs are suitable for
       specific scenarios. For example, if a bucket owner allows other AWS accounts to upload objects,
       permissions to these objects can only be managed using the object ACL by the AWS account that
       owns the object.

       C. The EC2 instances of each account will receive a total of 750*3 micro instance hours free
       D. The free usage tier for all the 3 accounts will be 3 years and not a single year

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       AWS consolidated billing enables the organization to consolidate payments for multiple Amazon
       Web Services (AWS. accounts within a single organization by making a single paying account.
       For billing purposes, AWS treats all the accounts on the consolidated bill as one account. Some
       services, such as Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 have volume pricing tiers across certain usage
       dimensions that give the user lower prices when he uses the service more.

       A user has launched two EBS backed EC2 instances in the US-East-1a region. The user wants
       to change the zone of one of the instances. How can the user change it?

       A. Stop one of the instances and change the availability zone
       B. The zone can only be modified using the AWS CLI
       C. From the AWS EC2 console, select the Actions - > Change zones and specify new zone
       D. Create an AMI of the running instance and launch the instance in a separate AZ

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       With AWS EC2, when a user is launching an instance he can select the availability zone (AZ. at
       the time of launch. If the zone is not selected, AWS selects it on behalf of the user. Once the
       instance is launched, the user cannot change the zone of that instance unless he creates an
       AMI of that instance and launches a new instance from it.

       sensor devices at his home which receives data on the HTTP end point (REST calls. and turn on
       the red light. The user can configure the CloudWatch alarm to send a notification to the AWS SNS
       HTTP end point (the sensor device. and it will turn the light red when there is an alarm condition.

   QUESTION NO: 137

       An organization has added 3 of his AWS accounts to consolidated billing. One of the
       AWS accounts has purchased a Reserved Instance (RI. of a small instance size in the US-East-1a zone.
       All other AWS accounts are running instances of a small size in the same zone. What will happen in 
       this case for the RI pricing?

       A. Only the account that has purchased the RI will get the advantage of RI pricing
       B. One instance of a small size and running in the US-East-1a zone of each AWS account will
          get the benefit of RI pricing
       C. Any single instance from all the three accounts can get the benefit of AWS RI pricing if they are
          running in the same zone and are of the same size
       D. If there are more than one instances of a small size running across multiple accounts in
          the same zone no one will get the benefit of RI

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       AWS consolidated billing enables the organization to consolidate payments for multiple Amazon
       Web Services (AWS. accounts within a single organization by making a single paying account.
       For billing purposes, consolidated billing treats all the accounts on the consolidated bill as one
       account. This means that all accounts on a consolidated bill can receive the hourly cost benefit of
       the Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances purchased by any other account. In this case only one
       Reserved Instance has been purchased by one account. Thus, only a single instance from any of
       the accounts will get the advantage of RI. AWS will implement the blended rate for each instance
       if more than one instance is running concurrently.

       C. Create 5 separate IAM users and set a different policy for their access
       D. Create 5 separate IAM groups and add users as per the department’s employees

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       AWS consolidated billing enables the organization to consolidate payments for multiple Amazon
       Web Services (AWS. accounts within a single organization by making a single paying account.
       Consolidated billing enables the organization to see a combined view of the AWS charges
       incurred by each account as well as obtain a detailed cost report for each of the individual AWS
       accounts associated with the paying account.

       A user has setup an EBS backed instance and a CloudWatch alarm when the CPU utilization is
       more than 65%. The user has setup the alarm to watch it for 5 periods of 5 minutes each. The
       CPU utilization is 60% between 9 AM to 6 PM. The user has stopped the EC2 instance for 15
       minutes between 11 AM to 11:15 AM. What will be the status of the alarm at 11:30 AM?

       A. Alarm
       B. OK
       C. Insufficient Data
       D. Error

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       Amazon CloudWatch alarm watches a single metric over a time period the user specifies and
       performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a
       number of time periods. The state of the alarm will be OK for the whole day. When the user stops
       the instance for three periods the alarm may not receive the data

   QUESTION NO: 140

       A user is running one instance for only 3 hours every day. The user wants to save some cost with
       the instance. Which of the below mentioned Reserved Instance categories is advised in this case?

       A. The user should not use RI; instead only go with the on-demand pricing
       B. The user should use the AWS high utilized RI
       C. The user should use the AWS medium utilized RI
       D. The user should use the AWS low utilized RI

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       The AWS Reserved Instance provides the user with an option to save some money by paying a
       one-time fixed amount and then save on the hourly rate. It is advisable that if the user is having
       30% or more usage of an instance per day, he should go for a RI. If the user is going to use an
       EC2 instance for more than 2200-2500 hours per year, RI will help the user save some cost.
       Here, the instance is not going to run for less than 1500 hours. Thus, it is advisable that the user
       should use the on-demand pricing.

       A user is trying to setup a recurring Auto Scaling process. The user has setup one process to
       scale up every day at 8 am and scale down at 7 PM. The user is trying to setup another
       recurring process which scales up on the 1st of every month at 8 AM and scales down the same
       day at 7 PM. What will Auto Scaling do in this scenario?

       A. Auto Scaling will execute both processes but will add just one instance on the 1st
       B. Auto Scaling will add two instances on the 1st of the month
       C. Auto Scaling will schedule both the processes but execute only one process randomly
       D. Auto Scaling will throw an error since there is a conflict in the schedule of two separate Auto
          Scaling Processes

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       Auto Scaling based on a schedule allows the user to scale the application in response to
       predictable load changes. The user can also configure the recurring schedule action which will
       follow the Linux cron format. As per Auto Scaling, a scheduled action must have a unique time value.
       If the user attempts to schedule an activity at a time when another existing activity is already 
       scheduled, the call will be rejected with an error message noting the conflict.

       use Auto Scaling based on the schedule for proactive scaling. What advise would you give to the
       user?

       A. It is good to schedule now because if the user forgets later on it will not scale up
       B. The scaling should be setup only one week before Christmas
       C. Wait till end of November before scheduling the activity
       D. It is not advisable to use scheduled based scaling

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       Auto Scaling based on a schedule allows the user to scale the application in response to
       predictable load changes. The user can specify any date in the future to scale up or down during that 
       period. As per Auto Scaling the user can schedule an action for up to a month in the future. Thus, 
       it is recommended to wait until end of November before scheduling for Christmas.

       You are managing the AWS account of a big organization. The organization has more than 1000+
       employees and they want to provide access to the various services to most of the employees.
       Which of the below mentioned options is the best possible solution in this case?

       A. The user should create a separate IAM user for each employee and provide access to them as
          per the policy
       B. The user should create an IAM role and attach STS with the role. The user should attach
          that role to the EC2 instance and setup AWS authentication on that server
       C. The user should create IAM groups as per the organization’s departments and add each user
          to the group for better access control
       D. Attach an IAM role with the organization’s authentication service to authorize each user
          for various AWS services

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       AWS Identity and Access Management is a web service which allows organizations to manage
       users and user permissions for various AWS services. The user is managing an AWS account for
       an organization that already has an identity system, such as the login system for the corporate
       network (SSO.. In this case, instead of creating individual IAM users or groups for each user who
       need AWS access, it may be more practical to use a proxy server to translate the user identities
       from the organization network into the temporary AWS security credentials. This proxy server will
       attach an IAM role to the user after authentication.

       A user has configured a VPC with a new subnet. The user has created a security group. The user
       wants to configure that instances of the same subnet communicate with each other. How can the
       user configure this with the security group?

       A. There is no need for a security group modification as all the instances can communicate
          with each other inside the same subnet
       B. Configure the subnet as the source in the security group and allow traffic on all the
          protocols and ports
       C. Configure the security group itself as the source and allow traffic on all the protocols and ports
       D. The user has to use VPC peering to configure this

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC. is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. AWS
       provides two features that the user can use to increase security in VPC: security groups and
       network ACLs. Security groups work at the instance level. If the user is using the default security
       group it will have a rule which allows the instances to communicate with other. For a new security
       group the user has to specify the rule, add it to define the source as the security group itself, and
       select all the protocols and ports for that source.

   QUESTION NO: 149

       A user is launching an instance. He is on the “Tag the instance” screen. Which of the below
       mentioned information will not help the user understand the functionality of an AWS tag?

       A. Each tag will have a key and value
       B. The user can apply tags to the S3 bucket
       C. The maximum value of the tag key length is 64 unicode characters
       D. AWS tags are used to find the cost distribution of various resources

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       AWS provides cost allocation tags to categorize and track the AWS costs. When the user applies
       tags to his AWS resources, AWS generates a cost allocation report as a comma-separated value
       (CSV file. with the usage and costs aggregated by those tags. Each tag will have a key-value and
       can be applied to services, such as EC2, S3, RDS, EMR, etc. The maximum size of a tag key is
       128 unicode characters.

   QUESTION NO: 150

       A user has created a VPC with CIDR 20.0.0.0/16. The user has created public and VPN only
       subnets along with hardware VPN access to connect to the user’s datacenter. The user wants to
       make so that all traffic coming to the public subnet follows the organization’s proxy policy. How
       can the user make this happen?
       A. Setting up a NAT with the proxy protocol and configure that the public subnet receives
          traffic from NAT
       B. Settin up a proxy policy in the internet gateway connected with the public subnet
       C. It is not possible to setup the proxy policy for a public subnet
       D. Setting the route table and security group of the public subnet which receives traffic
          from a virtual private gateway

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       The user can create subnets within a VPC. If the user wants to connect to VPC from his own data
       centre, he can setup public and VPN only subnets which uses hardware VPN access to connect
       with his data centre. When the user has configured this setup, it will update the main route table
       used with the VPN-only subnet, create a custom route table and associate it with the public
       subnet. It also creates an internet gateway for the public subnet. By default the internet traffic of
       the VPN subnet is routed to a virtual private gateway while the internet traffic of the public subnet
       is routed through the internet gateway. The user can set up the route and security group rules.
       These rules enable the traffic to come from the organization’s network over the virtual private
       gateway to the public subnet to allow proxy settings on that public subnet.

   QUESTION NO: 151

       A user has created a VPC with CIDR 20.0.0.0/24. The user has created a public subnet with
       CIDR 20.0.0.0/25 and a private subnet with CIDR 20.0.0.128/25. The user has launched one
       instance each in the private and public subnets. Which of the below mentioned options cannot be
       the correct IP address (private IP. assigned to an instance in the public or private subnet?

       A. 20.0.0.255
       B. 20.0.0.132
       C. 20.0.0.122
       D. 20.0.0.55

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       When the user creates a subnet in VPC, he specifies the CIDR block for the subnet. In this case
       the user has created a VPC with the CIDR block 20.0.0.0/24, which supports 256 IP addresses
       (20.0.0.0 to 20.0.0.255.. The public subnet will have IP addresses between 20.0.0.0 - 20.0.0.127
       and the private subnet will have IP addresses between 20.0.0.128 - 20.0.0.255. AWS reserves
       the first four IP addresses and the last IP address in each subnet’s CIDR block. These are not
       available for the user to use. Thus, the instance cannot have an IP address of 20.0.0.255

   QUESTION NO: 152

       A user has launched an EBS backed EC2 instance. The user has rebooted the instance. Which of
       the below mentioned statements is not true with respect to the reboot action?

       A. The private and public address remains the same
       B. The Elastic IP remains associated with the instance
       C. The volume is preserved
       D. The instance runs on a new host computer

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       A user can reboot an EC2 instance using the AWS console, the Amazon EC2 CLI or the
       Amazon EC2 API. Rebooting an instance is equivalent to rebooting an operating system.
       However, it is recommended that the user use the Amazon EC2 to reboot the instance instead of
       running the operating system reboot command from the instance. The instance remains on the
       same host computer and maintains its public DNS name, private IP address, and any data on its
       instance store volumes. It typically takes a few minutes for the reboot to complete, but the time it
       takes to reboot depends on the instance configuration.

   QUESTION NO: 153

       A user has setup a web application on EC2. The user is generating a log of the application
       performance at every second. There are multiple entries for each second. If the user wants to
       send that data to CloudWatch every minute, what should he do?

       A. The user should send only the data of the 60th second as CloudWatch will map the
          receive data timezone with the sent data timezone
       B. It is not possible to send the custom metric to CloudWatch every minute
       C. Give CloudWatch the Min, Max, Sum, and SampleCount of a number of every minute
       D. Calculate the average of one minute and send the data to CloudWatch

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       Amazon CloudWatch aggregates statistics according to the period length that the user has
       specified while getting data from CloudWatch. The user can publish as many data points as he 
       wants with the same or similartime stamps. CloudWatch aggregates them by the period length when 
       the user calls get statistics about those data points. CloudWatch records the average (sum of all
       items divided by the number of items. of the values received for every 1-minute period, as well as
       the number of samples, maximum value, and minimum value for the same time period. CloudWatch
       will aggregate all the data which have time stamps within a one-minute period.

          RDS services
       D. The policy should be created for the user and provide access for RDS

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       AWS Identity and Access Management is a web service which allows organizations to manage
       users and user permissions for various AWS services. If the account owner wants to create a
       policy for RDS, the owner has to create an IAM user and define the policy which entitles the
       IAM user with various RDS services such as Launch Instance, Manage security group, Manage
       parameter group etc.

       A user is using a small MySQL RDS DB. The user is experiencing high latency due to the Multi
       AZ feature.Which of the below mentioned options may not help the user in this situation?

       A. Schedule the automated back up in non-working hours
       B. Use a large or higher size instance
       C. Use PIOPS
       D. Take a snapshot from standby Replica

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       An RDS DB instance which has enabled Multi AZ deployments may experience increased write
       and commit latency compared to a Single AZ deployment, due to synchronous data replication.
       The user may also face changes in latency if deployment fails over to the standby replica. For
       production workloads, AWS recommends the user to use provisioned IOPS and DB instance
       classes (m1.large and larger. as they are optimized for provisioned IOPS to give a fast, and
       consistent performance. With Multi AZ feature, the user can not have option to take snapshot
       from replica.

       A user is displaying the CPU utilization, and Network in and Network out CloudWatch metrics
       data of a single instance on the same graph. The graph uses one Y-axis for CPU utilization and
       Network in and another Y-axis for Network out. Since Network in is too high, the CPU utilization
       data is not visible clearly on graph to the user. How can the data be viewed better on the same
       graph?

       A. It is not possible to show multiple metrics with the different units on the same graph
       B. Add a third Y-axis with the console to show all the data in proportion
       C. Change the axis of Network by using the Switch command from the graph
       D. Change the units of CPU utilization so it can be shown in proportion with Network

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       Amazon CloudWatch provides the functionality to graph the metric data generated either by the
       AWS services or the custom metric to make it easier for the user to analyse. It is possible to
       show the multiple metrics with different units on the same graph. If the graph is not plotted
       properly due to a difference in the unit data over two metrics, the user can change the Y-axis of
       one of the graph by selecting that graph and clicking on the Switch option.

       A user is planning to schedule a backup for an EBS volume. The user wants security of the
       snapshot data. How can the user achieve data encryption with a snapshot?

       A. Use encrypted EBS volumes so that the snapshot will be encrypted by AWS
       B. While creating a snapshot select the snapshot with encryption
       C. By default the snapshot is encrypted by AWS
       D. Enable server side encryption for the snapshot using S3

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       AWS EBS supports encryption of the volume. It also supports creating volumes from existing
       snapshots provided the snapshots are created from encrypted volumes. The data at rest, the I/O
       as well as all the snapshots of the encrypted EBS will also be encrypted. EBS encryption is based
       on the AES-256 cryptographic algorithm, which is the industry standard.

       A user has created a public subnet with VPC and launched an EC2 instance within it. The user
       is trying to delete the subnet. What will happen in this scenario?

       A. It will delete the subnet and make the EC2 instance as a part of the default subnet
       B. It will not allow the user to delete the subnet until the instances are terminated
       C. It will delete the subnet as well as terminate the instances
       D. The subnet can never be deleted independently, but the user has to delete the VPC first

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC. is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. A user
       can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. When an instance is
       launched it will have a network interface attached with it. The user cannot delete the subnet until
       he terminates the instance and deletes the network interface.

       A user has setup an EBS backed instance and attached 2 EBS volumes to it. The user has setup
       a CloudWatch alarm on each volume for the disk data. The user has stopped the EC2 instance and
       detached the EBS volumes. What will be the status of the alarms on the EBS volume?

       A. OK
       B. Insufficient Data
       C. Alarm
       D. The EBS cannot be detached until all the alarms are removed

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       Amazon CloudWatch alarm watches a single metric over a time period that the user specifies
       and performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold
       over a number of time periods. Alarms invoke actions only for sustained state changes. There
       are three states of the alarm: OK, Alarm and Insufficient data. In this case since the EBS is
       detached and inactive the state will be Insufficient.

       A user has launched an EC2 instance from an instance store backed AMI. The infrastructure team
       wants to create an AMI from the running instance. Which of the below mentioned credentials is not
       required while creating the AMI?

       A. AWS account ID
       B. X.509 certificate and private key
       C. AWS login ID to login to the console
       D. Access key and secret access key

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       When the user has launched an EC2 instance from an instance store backed AMI and the admin
       team wants to create an AMI from it, the user needs to setup the AWS AMI or the API tools first.
       Once the tool is setup the user will need the following credentials:
       AWS account ID;
       AWS access and secret access key;
       X.509 certificate with private key.

       A user has configured an SSL listener at ELB as well as on the back-end instances. Which of
       the below mentioned statements helps the user understand ELB traffic handling with respect to the
       SSL listener?

       A. It is not possible to have the SSL listener both at ELB and back-end instances
       B. ELB will modify headers to add requestor details
       C. ELB will intercept the request to add the cookie details if sticky session is enabled
       D. ELB will not modify the headers

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       When the user has configured Transmission Control Protocol (TCP. or Secure Sockets Layer
       (SSL. for both front-end and back-end connections of the Elastic Load Balancer, the load balancer
       forwards the request to the back-end instances without modifying the request headers unless the
       proxy header is enabled. SSL does not support sticky sessions. If the user has enabled a proxy
       protocol it adds the source and destination IP to the header.

   QUESTION NO: 163

       A user has created a Cloudformation stack. The stack creates AWS services, such as EC2 instances,
       ELB, AutoScaling, and RDS. While creating the stack it created EC2, ELB and AutoScaling but
       failed to create RDS. What will Cloudformation do in this scenario?

       A. Cloudformation can never throw an error after launching a few services since it verifies all
          the steps before launching.
       B. It will warn the user about the error and ask the user to manually create RDS
       C. Rollback all the changes and terminate all the created services
       D. It will wait for the user’s input about the error and correct the mistake after the input

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       AWS Cloudformation is an application management tool which provides application modelling,
       deployment, configuration, management and related activities. The AWS Cloudformation stack is
       a collection of AWS resources which are created and managed as a single unit when AWS
       CloudFormation instantiates a template. If any of the services fails to launch, Cloudformation will
       rollback all the changes and terminate or delete all the created services.

       achieve encryption of the EBS volume. How can the user encrypt the data at rest?

       A. Use AWS EBS encryption to encrypt the data at rest
       B. The user cannot use EBS encryption and has to encrypt the data manually or using a
          third party tool
       C. The user has to select the encryption enabled flag while launching the EC2 instance
       D. Encryption of volume is not available as a part of the free usage tier

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       AWS EBS supports encryption of the volume while creating new volumes. It supports encryption
       of the data at rest, the I/O as well as all the snapshots of the EBS volume. The EBS supports
       encryption for the selected instance type and the newer generation instances, such as m3, c3,
       cr1, r3, g2. It is not supported with a micro instance.

   QUESTION NO: 165

       A user has created a VPC with public and private subnets using the VPC wizard. The user has
       not launched any instance manually and is trying to delete the VPC. What will happen in this
       scenario?

       A. It will not allow to delete the VPC as it has subnets with route tables
       B. It will not allow to delete the VPC since it has a running route instance
       C. It will terminate the VPC along with all the instances launched by the wizard
       D. It will not allow to delete the VPC since it has a running NAT instance

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC. is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. A user
       can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. If the user has created a
       public private subnet, the instances in the public subnet can receive inbound traffic directly from
       the Internet, whereas the instances in the private subnet cannot. If these subnets are created with
       Wizard, AWS will create a NAT instance with an elastic IP. If the user is trying to delete the VPC it
       will not allow as the NAT instance is still running.

       An organization is measuring the latency of an application every minute and storing data inside a
       file in the JSON format. The organization wants to send all latency data to AWS CloudWatch.
       How can the organization achieve this?

       A. The user has to parse the file before uploading data to CloudWatch
       B. It is not possible to upload the custom data to CloudWatch
       C. The user can supply the file as an input to the CloudWatch command
       D. The user can use the CloudWatch Import command to import data from the file to CloudWatch

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       AWS CloudWatch supports the custom metrics. The user can always capture the custom data
       and upload the data to CloudWatch using CLI or APIs. The user has to always include the
       namespace as part of the request. If the user wants to upload the custom data from a file, he can
       supply file name along with the parameter -- metric-data to command put-metric-data.

   QUESTION NO: 167

       A user has launched an EBS backed instance with EC2-Classic. The user stops and starts
       the instance. Which of the below mentioned statements is not true with respect to the
       stop/start action?

       A. The instance gets new private and public IP addresses
       B. The volume is preserved
       C. The Elastic IP remains associated with the instance
       D. The instance may run on a anew host computer

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       A user can always stop/start an EBS backed EC2 instance. When the user stops the instance, it
       first enters the stopping state, and then the stopped state. AWS does not charge the running cost
       but charges only for the EBS storage cost. If the instance is running in EC2-Classic, it receives a
       new private IP address; as the Elastic IP address (EIP. associated with the instance is no longer
       associated with that instance.

   QUESTION NO: 168

       A user has launched an RDS postgreSQL DB with AWS. The user did not specify the maintenance
       window during creation. The user has configured RDS to update the DB instance type from micro
       to large. If the user wants to have it during the maintenance window, what will AWS do?

       A. AWS will not allow to update the DB until the maintenance window is configured
       B. AWS will select the default maintenance window if the user has not provided it
       C. AWS will ask the user to specify the maintenance window during the update
       D. It is not possible to change the DB size from micro to large with RDS

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       AWS RDS has a compulsory maintenance window which by default is 30 minutes. If the user does
       not specify the maintenance window during the creation of RDS then AWS will select a 30-minute
       maintenance window randomly from an 8-hour block of time per region. In this case, Amazon RDS
       assigns a 30-minute maintenance window on a randomly selected day of the week.

   QUESTION NO: 169

       A user has created a subnet in VPC and launched an EC2 instance within it. The user has not
       selected the option to assign the IP address while launching the instance. The user has 3 elastic
       IPs and is trying to assign one of the Elastic IPs to the VPC instance from the console. The
       console does not show any instance in the IP assignment screen. What is a possible reason that
       the instance is unavailable in the assigned IP console?

       A. The IP address may be attached to one of the instances
       B. The IP address belongs to a different zone than the subnet zone
       C. The user has not created an internet gateway
       D. The IP addresses belong to EC2 Classic; so they cannot be assigned to VPC

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC. is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. A user can
       create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. When the user is launching an
       instance he needs toselect an option which attaches a public IP to the instance. If the user has not
       selected the option to attach the public IP then it will only have a private IP when launched. If the
       user wants to connect to an instance from the internet he should create an elastic IP with VPC. If
       the elastic IP is a part of EC2 Classic it cannot be assigned to a VPC instance.

   QUESTION NO: 170

       A user has launched multiple EC2 instances for the purpose of development and testing in the
       same region. The user wants to find the separate cost for the production and development
       instances. How can the user find the cost distribution?

       A. The user should download the activity report of the EC2 services as it has the instance ID wise
          data
       B. It is not possible to get the AWS cost usage data of single region instances separately
       C. The user should use Cost Distribution Metadata and AWS detailed billing
       D. The user should use Cost Allocation Tags and AWS billing reports

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       AWS provides cost allocation tags to categorize and track the AWS costs. When the user
       applies tags to his AWS resources (such as Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon S3 buckets.,
       AWS generates a cost allocation report as a comma-separated value (CSV file. with the usage
       and costs aggregated by those tags. The user can apply tags which represent business
       categories (such as cost centres, application names, or instance type – Production/Dev. to
       organize usage costs across multiple services.

   QUESTION NO: 171

       A user has created a VPC with CIDR 20.0.0.0/16 using VPC Wizard. The user has created a
       public CIDR (20.0.0.0/24) and a VPN only subnet CIDR (20.0.1.0/24) along with the hardware
       VPN access to connect to the user’s data centre. Which of the below mentioned components is not
       present when the VPC is setup with the wizard?

       A. Main route table attached with a VPN only subnet
       B. A NAT instance configured to allow the VPN subnet instances to connect with the internet
       C. Custom route table attached with a public subnet
       D. An internet gateway for a public subnet

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       The user can create subnets as per the requirement within a VPC. If the user wants to connect
       VPC from his own data centre, he can setup a public and VPN only subnet which uses hardware
       VPN access to connect with his data centre. When the user has configured this setup with
       Wizard, it will update the main route table used with the VPN-only subnet, create a custom route
       table and associate it with the public subnet. It also creates an internet gateway for the public
       subnet. The wizard does not create a NAT instance by default. The user can create it manually
       and attach it with a VPN only subnet.

   QUESTION NO: 172

       A user has created a VPC with the public subnet. The user has created a security group for
       that VPC. Which of the below mentioned statements is true when a security group is created?

       A. It can connect to the AWS services, such as S3 and RDS by default
       B. It will have all the inbound traffic by default
       C. It will have all the outbound traffic by default
       D. It will by default allow traffic to the internet gateway

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC. is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. AWS
       provides two features the user can use to increase security in VPC: security groups and network
       ACLs. Security groups work at the instance level while ACLs work at the subnet level. When a
       user creates a security group with AWS VPC, by default it will allow all the outbound traffic but
       block all inbound traffic.

       A user has setup an Auto Scaling group. The group has failed to launch a single instance for more
       than 24 hours. What will happen to Auto Scaling in this condition?

       A. Auto Scaling will keep trying to launch the instance for 72 hours
       B. Auto Scaling will suspend the scaling process
       C. Auto Scaling will start an instance in a separate region
       D. The Auto Scaling group will be terminated automatically

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       If Auto Scaling is trying to launch an instance and if the launching of the instance
       fails continuously, it will suspend the processes for the Auto Scaling groups since it repeatedly
       failed to launch an instance. This is known as an administrative suspension. It commonly applies to
       the Auto Scaling group that has no running instances which is trying to launch instances for more than
       24 hours, and has not succeeded in that to do so.

   QUESTION NO: 174

       A user is planning to set up the Multi AZ feature of RDS. Which of the below mentioned conditions
       won't take advantage of the Multi AZ feature?

       A. Availability zone outage
       B. A manual failover of the DB instance using Reboot with failover option
       C. Region outage
       D. When the user changes the DB instance’s server type

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       Amazon RDS when enabled with Multi AZ will handle failovers automatically. Thus, the user can
       resume database operations as quickly as possible without administrative intervention. The primary DB
       instance switches over automatically to the standby replica if any of the following conditions occur:
       An Availability Zone outage
       The primary DB instance fails
       The DB instance's server type is changed
       The DB instance is undergoing software patching
       A manual failover of the DB instance was initiated using Reboot with failover

   QUESTION NO: 175

       An organization has configured Auto Scaling with ELB. One of the instance health check returns
       the status as Impaired to Auto Scaling. What will Auto Scaling do in this scenario?

       A. Perform a health check until cool down before declaring that the instance has failed
       B. Terminate the instance and launch a new instance
       C. Notify the user using SNS for the failed state
       D. Notify ELB to stop sending traffic to the impaired instance

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       The Auto Scaling group determines the health state of each instance periodically by checking the
       results of the Amazon EC2 instance status checks. If the instance status description shows any
       other state other than “running” or the system status description shows impaired, Auto Scaling
       considers the instance to be unhealthy. Thus, it terminates the instance and launches a replacement.

   QUESTION NO: 176

       A user is using Cloudformation to launch an EC2 instance and then configure an application after
       the instance is launched. The user wants the stack creation of ELB and AutoScaling to wait until
       the EC2 instance is launched and configured properly. How can the user configure this?

       A. It is not possible that the stack creation will wait until one service is created and launched
       B. The user can use the HoldCondition resource to wait for the creation of the other dependent
          resources
       C. The user can use the DependentCondition resource to hold the creation of the other
          dependent resources
       D. The user can use the WaitCondition resource to hold the creation of the other 1034
          dependent resources

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       AWS Cloudformation is an application management tool which provides application modelling,
       deployment, configuration, management and related activities. AWS CloudFormation provides a
       WaitCondition resource which acts as a barrier and blocks the creation of other resources until a
       completion signal is received from an external source, such as a user application or management
       system.

   QUESTION NO: 177

       An organization has configured two single availability zones. The Auto Scaling groups are
       configured in separate zones. The user wants to merge the groups such that one group spans across
       multiple zones. How can the user configure this?

       A. Run the command as-join-auto-scaling-group to join the two groups
       B. Run the command as-update-auto-scaling-group to configure one group to span across zones
          and delete the other group
       C. Run the command as-copy-auto-scaling-group to join the two groups
       D. Run the command as-merge-auto-scaling-group to merge the groups

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       If the user has configured two separate single availability zone Auto Scaling groups and wants to
       merge them then he should update one of the groups and delete the other one. While updating
       the first group it is recommended that the user should increase the size of the minimum,
       maximum and desired capacity as a summation of both the groups.

       An AWS account wants to be part of the consolidated billing of his organization’s payee account.
       How can the owner of that account achieve this?

       A. The payee account has to request AWS support to link the other accounts with his account
       B. The owner of the linked account should add the payee account to his master account list
          from the billing console
       C. The payee account will send a request to the linked account to be a part of consolidated billing
       D. The owner of the linked account requests the payee account to add his account to
          consolidated billing

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       AWS consolidated billing enables the organization to consolidate payments for multiple Amazon
       Web Services (AWS. accounts within a single organization by making a single paying account.
       To add a particular account (linked. to the master (payee. account, the payee account has to
       request the linked account to join consolidated billing. Once the linked account accepts the
       request henceforth all charges incurred by the linked account will be paid by the payee account.

   QUESTION NO: 179

       A sysadmin has created the below mentioned policy on an S3 bucket named cloudacademy. What
       does this policy define?
       "Statement": [{
       "Sid": "Stmt1388811069831",
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": { "AWS": "*"},
       "Action": [ "s3:GetObjectAcl", "s3:ListBucket"],
       "Resource": [ "arn:aws:s3:::cloudacademy]
       }]

       A. It will make the cloudacademy bucket as well as all its objects as public
       B. It will allow everyone to view the ACL of the bucket
       C. It will give an error as no object is defined as part of the policy while the action defines the
          rule about the object
       D. It will make the cloudacademy bucket as public

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       A sysadmin can grant permission to the S3 objects or the buckets to any user or make objects
       public using the bucket policy and user policy. Both use the JSON-based access policy
       language. Generally if the user is defining the ACL on the bucket, the objects in the bucket do not
       inherit it and vice a versa. The bucket policy can be defined at the bucket level which allows the
       objects as well as the bucket to be public with a single policy applied to that bucket. In the
       sample policy the action says “S3:ListBucket” for effect Allow on Resource
       arn:aws:s3:::cloudacademy. This will make the cloudacademy bucket public.
       "Statement": [{
       "Sid": "Stmt1388811069831",

       A user has launched two EBS backed EC2 instances in the US-East-1a region. The user wants
       to change the zone of one of the instances. How can the user change it?

       A. The zone can only be modified using the AWS CLI
       B. It is not possible to change the zone of an instance after it is launched
       C. Stop one of the instances and change the availability zone
       D. From the AWS EC2 console, select the Actions - > Change zones and specify the new zone

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       With AWS EC2, when a user is launching an instance he can select the availability zone (AZ. at
       the time of launch. If the zone is not selected, AWS selects it on behalf of the user. Once the
       instance is launched, the user cannot change the zone of that instance unless he creates an
       AMI of that instance and launches a new instance from it.

       C. Allow the IAM user to update the membership of the group called TestingGroup
       D. Allow the IAM user to delete the TestingGroup

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       AWS Identity and Access Management is a web service which allows organizations to manage
       users and user permissions for various AWS services. If the organization (account ID
       123412341234. wants their users to manage their subscription to the groups, they should create a
       relevant policy for that. The below mentioned policy allows the respective IAM user to update the
       membership of the group called MarketingGroup.

       A user has configured ELB with two EBS backed instances. The user has stopped the instances
       for 1 week to save costs. The user restarts the instances after 1 week. Which of the below
       mentioned statements will help the user to understand the ELB and instance registration better?

       A. There is no way to register the stopped instances with ELB
       B. The user cannot stop the instances if they are registered with ELB
       C. If the instances have the same Elastic IP assigned after reboot they will be registered with ELB
       D. The instances will automatically get registered with ELB

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       Elastic Load Balancing registers the user’s load balancer with his EC2 instance using the
       associated IP address. When the instances are stopped and started back they will have a
       different IP address. Thus, they will not get registered with ELB unless the user manually
       registers them. If the instances are assigned the same Elastic IP after reboot they will
       automatically get registered with ELB.

       A user is trying to connect to a running EC2 instance using SSH. However, the user gets a Host
       key not found error. Which of the below mentioned options is a possible reason for rejection?

       A. The user has provided the wrong user name for the OS login
       B. The instance CPU is heavily loaded
       C. The security group is not configured properly
       D. The access key to connect to the instance is wrong

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       If the user is trying to connect to a Linux EC2 instance and receives the Host Key not found
       error the probable reasons are: The private key pair is not right The user name to login is wrong

   QUESTION NO: 184

       A user is using the AWS EC2. The user wants to make so that when there is an issue in the EC2
       server, such as instance status failed, it should start a new instance in the user’s private cloud.
       Which AWS service helps to achieve this automation?

       A. AWS CloudWatch + Cloudformation
       B. AWS CloudWatch + AWS AutoScaling + AWS ELB
       C. AWS CloudWatch + AWS VPC
       D. AWS CloudWatch + AWS SNS

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       Amazon SNS can deliver notifications by SMS text message or email to the Amazon Simple
       Queue Service (SQS. queues or to any HTTP endpoint. The user can configure a web service
       (HTTP End point. in his data centre which receives data and launches an instance in the private
       cloud. The user should configure the CloudWatch alarm to send a notification to SNS when the
       “StatusCheckFailed” metric is true for the EC2 instance. The SNS topic can be configured to
       send a notification to the user’s HTTP end point which launches an instance in the private cloud.

   QUESTION NO: 186

       A sys admin has enabled logging on ELB. Which of the below mentioned fields will not be a part of
       the log file name?

       A. Load Balancer IP
       B. EC2 instance IP
       C. S3 bucket name
       D. Random string

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       Elastic Load Balancing access logs capture detailed information for all the requests made to the
       load balancer. Elastic Load Balancing publishes a log file from each load balancer node at the
       interval that the user has specified. The load balancer can deliver multiple logs for the same
       period. Elastic Load Balancing creates log file names in the following format: “{Bucket}/{Prefix}/
       AWSLogs/{AWS AccountID}/elasticloadbalancing/{Region}/{Year}/{Month}/{Day}/{AWS
       Account ID}_elasticloadbalancing_{Region}_{Load Balancer Name}_{End Time}_{Load Balancer
       IP}_{Random String}.log“

   QUESTION NO: 187

       A user has created a queue named “awsmodule” with SQS. One of the consumers of queue is
       down for 3 days and then becomes available. Will that component receive message from queue?

       A. Yes, since SQS by default stores message for 4 days
       B. No, since SQS by default stores message for 1 day only
       C. No, since SQS sends message to consumers who are available that time
       D. Yes, since SQS will not delete message until it is delivered to all consumers

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       SQS allows the user to move data between distributed components of applications so they can
       perform different tasks without losing messages or requiring each component to be always available.
       Queues retain messages for a set period of time. By default, a queue retains messages for four
       days. However, the user can configure a queue to retain messages for up to 14 days after the
       message has been sent.

   QUESTION NO: 188

       An organization has setup multiple IAM users. The organization wants that each IAM user accesses
       the IAM console only within the organization and not from outside. How can it achieve this?

       A. Create an IAM policy with the security group and use that security group for AWS console login
       B. Create an IAM policy with a condition which denies access when the IP address range is
          not from the organization
       C. Configure the EC2 instance security group which allows traffic only from the organization’s
          IP range
       D. Create an IAM policy with VPC and allow a secure gateway between the organization and
          AWS Console

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       AWS Identity and Access Management is a web service which allows organizations to manage
       users and user permissions for various AWS services. The user can add conditions as a part of
       the IAM policies. The condition can be set on AWS Tags, Time, and Client IP as well as on many
       other parameters. If the organization wants the user to access only from a specific IP range, they
       should set an IAM policy condition which denies access when the IP is not in a certain range. E.g.
       The sample policy given below denies all traffic when the IP is not in a certain range.
       "Statement": [{
       "Effect": "Deny",
       "Action": "*",
       "Resource": "*",
       "Condition": {
       "NotIpAddress": {
       "aws:SourceIp": ["10.10.10.0/24", "20.20.30.0/24"]
       }
       }
       }]

       An organization has created one IAM user and applied the below mentioned policy to the user.
       What entitlements do the IAM users avail with this policy?
       {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
       {
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Action": "ec2:Describe*",

       {
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Action": "autoscaling:Describe*",
       "Resource": "*"
       }
       ]
       }

       A. The policy will allow the user to perform all read only activities on the EC2 services
       B. The policy will allow the user to list all the EC2 resources except EBS
       C. The policy will allow the user to perform all read and write activities on the EC2 services
       D. The policy will allow the user to perform all read only activities on the EC2 services except load
          Balancing

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       AWS Identity and Access Management is a web service which allows organizations to manage
       users and user permissions for various AWS services. If an organization wants to setup read only
       access to EC2 for a particular user, they should mention the action in the IAM policy which entitles
       the user for Describe rights for EC2, CloudWatch, Auto Scaling and ELB. In the policy shown
       below, the user will have read only access for EC2 and EBS, CloudWatch and Auto Scaling. Since
       ELB is not mentioned as a part of the list, the user will not have access to ELB.
       {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
       {
       "Effect": "Allow",

   QUESTION NO: 190

       A user has enabled session stickiness with ELB. The user does not want ELB to manage the cookie;
       instead he wants the application to manage the cookie. What will happen when the server instance,
       which is bound to a cookie, crashes?

       A. The response will have a cookie but stickiness will be deleted
       B. The session will not be sticky until a new cookie is inserted
       C. ELB will throw an error due to cookie unavailability
       D. The session will be sticky and ELB will route requests to another server as ELB keeps
          replicating the Cookie

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       With Elastic Load Balancer, if the admin has enabled a sticky session with application controlled
       stickiness, the load balancer uses a special cookie generated by the application to associate the
       session with the original server which handles the request. ELB follows the lifetime of the
       application-generated cookie corresponding to the cookie name specified in the ELB policy
       configuration. The load balancer only inserts a new stickiness cookie if the application response
       includes a new application cookie. The load balancer stickiness cookie does not update with
       each request. If the application cookie is explicitly removed or expires, the session stops being
       sticky until a new application cookie is issued.

       A user is observing the EC2 CPU utilization metric on CloudWatch. The user has observed some
       interesting patterns while filtering over the 1 week period for a particular hour. The user wants to
       zoom that data point to a more granular period. How can the user do that easily with CloudWatch?

       A. The user can zoom a particular period by selecting that period with the mouse and
       then releasing the mouse
       B. The user can zoom a particular period by double clicking on that period with the mouse
       C. The user can zoom a particular period by specifying the aggregation data for that period
       D. The user can zoom a particular period by specifying the period in the Time Range

       Answer: A

   QUESTION NO: 192

       A user has created an Auto Scaling group with default configurations from CLI. The user wants to
       setup the CloudWatch alarm on the EC2 instances, which are launched by the Auto Scaling
       group. The user has setup an alarm to monitor the CPU utilization every minute. Which of the
       below mentioned statements is true?

       A. It will fetch the data at every minute but the four data points [corresponding to 4 minutes]
          will not have value since the EC2 basic monitoring metrics are collected every five minutes
       B. It will fetch the data at every minute as detailed monitoring on EC2 will be enabled by
          the default launch configuration of Auto Scaling
       C. The alarm creation will fail since the user has not enabled detailed monitoring on the
           EC2 instances
       D . The user has to first enable detailed monitoring on the EC2 instances to support alarm
           monitoring at every minute   

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS as well as the custom services. To enable detailed instance
       monitoring for a new Auto Scaling group, the user does not need to take any extra steps. When
       the user creates an Auto Scaling launch config using CLI, each launch configuration contains a
       flag named InstanceMonitoring.Enabled. The default value of this flag is true. Thus, by default
       detailed monitoring will be enabled for Auto Scaling as well as for all the instances launched by
       that Auto Scaling group.

   QUESTION NO: 193

       A user has created a VPC with public and private subnets using the VPC wizard. Which of the
       below mentioned statements is not true in this scenario?

       A. The VPC will create a routing instance and attach it with a public subnet
       B. The VPC will create two subnets 116789
       C. The VPC will create one internet gateway and attach it to VPC
       D. The VPC will launch one NAT instance with an elastic IP

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       A user can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. If the user has
       created a public private subnet, the instances in the public subnet can receive inbound traffic
       directly from the internet, whereas the instances in the private subnet cannot. If these subnets are
       created with Wizard, AWS will create a NAT instance with an elastic IP. Wizard will also create two
       subnets with route tables. It will also create an internet gateway and attach it to the VPC.

   QUESTION NO: 194

       A user has configured ELB with a TCP listener at ELB as well as on the back-end instances. The
       user wants to enable a proxy protocol to capture the source and destination IP information in the
       header. Which of the below mentioned statements helps the user understand a proxy protocol
       with TCP configuration?

       A. If the end user is requesting behind a proxy server then the user should not enable a proxy
          protocol on ELB
       B. ELB does not support a proxy protocol when it is listening on both the load balancer and the
          backend instances
       C. Whether the end user is requesting from a proxy server or directly, it does not make a difference
          for the proxy protocol
       D. If the end user is requesting behind the proxy then the user should add the “isproxy” flag
          to the ELB Configuration

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       When the user has configured Transmission Control Protocol (TCP. or Secure Sockets Layer
       (SSL. for both front-end and back-end connections of the Elastic Load Balancer, the load balancer
       forwards the request to the back-end instances without modifying the request headers unless the
       proxy header is enabled. If the end user is requesting from a Proxy Protocol enabled proxy server,
       then the ELB admin should not enable the Proxy Protocol on the load balancer. If the Proxy
       Protocol is enabled on both the proxy server and the load balancer, the load balancer will add
       another header to the request which already has a header from the proxy server. This duplication
       may result in errors.

       A user has launched 5 instances in EC2-CLASSIC and attached 5 elastic IPs to the five different
       instances in the US East region. The user is creating a VPC in the same region. The user wants
       to assign an elastic IP to the VPC instance. How can the user achieve this?

       A. The user has to request AWS to increase the number of elastic IPs associated with the account
       B. AWS allows 10 EC2 Classic IPs per region ; so it will allow to allocate new Elastic IPs to the
          same region
       C. The AWS will not allow to create a new elastic IP in VPC; it will throw an error
       D. The user can allocate a new IP address in VPC as it has a different limit than EC2

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       Section: (none)
       A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC. is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. A user
       can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. A user can have 5 IP
       addresses per region with EC2 Classic. The user can have 5 separate IPs with VPC in the same
       region as it has a separate limit than EC2 Classic.

   QUESTION NO: 196

       A user has created a subnet in VPC and launched an EC2 instance within it. The user has not
       selected the option to assign the IP address while launching the instance. Which of the below
       mentioned statements is true with respect to this scenario?

       A. The instance will always have a public DNS attached to the instance by default
       B. The user can directly attach an elastic IP to the instance
       C. The instance will never launch if the public IP is not assigned
       D. The user would need to create an internet gateway and then attach an elastic IP to the
          instance to connect from internet

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC. is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. A user
       can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. When the user is
       launching an instance he needs to select an option which attaches a public IP to the instance. If
       the user has not selected the option to attach the public IP then it will only have a private IP when
       launched. The user cannot connect to the instance from the internet. If the user wants an elastic
       IP to connect to the instance from the internet he should create an internet gateway and assign an
       elastic IP to instance.

       ]
       }

       A. The policy is not created correctly. It will throw an error for wrong resource name
       B. The policy is for the group. Thus, the IAM user cannot have any entitlement to this
       C. It allows full access to all AWS services for the IAM users who are a part of this group
       D. If this policy is applied to the EC2 resource, the users of the group will have full access to
          the EC2 Resources

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       AWS Identity and Access Management is a web service which allows organizations to manage
       users and user permissions for various AWS services. The IAM group allows the organization to
       specify permissions for a collection of users. With the below mentioned policy, it will allow the

   QUESTION NO: 198

       A user is configuring a CloudWatch alarm on RDS to receive a notification when the CPU
       utilization of RDS is higher than 50%. The user has setup an alarm when there is some
       iinactivity on RDS, such as RDS unavailability. How can the user configure this?

       A. Setup the notification when the CPU is more than 75% on RDS
       B. Setup the notification when the state is Insufficient Data
       C. Setup the notification when the CPU utilization is less than 10%
       D. It is not possible to setup the alarm on RDS

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       Amazon CloudWatch alarms watch a single metric over a time period that the user specifies and
       performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a
       number of time periods. The alarm has three states: Alarm, OK and Insufficient data. The Alarm
       will change to Insufficient Data when any of the three situations arise: when the alarm has just
       started, when the metric is not available or when enough data is not available for the metric to
       determine the alarm state. If the user wants to find that RDS is not available, he can setup to
       receive the notification when the state is in Insufficient data.

       George has shared an EC2 AMI created in the US East region from his AWS account with
       Stefano. George copies the same AMI to the US West region. Can Stefano access the copied
       AMI of George’s account from the US West region?

       A. No, copy AMI does not copy the permission
       B. It is not possible to share the AMI with a specific account
       C. Yes, since copy AMI copies all private account sharing permissions
       D. Yes, since copy AMI copies all the permissions attached with the AMI

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       Within EC2, when the user copies an AMI, the new AMI is fully independent of the source AMI;
       there is no link to the original (source. AMI. AWS does not copy launch the permissions, userdefined
       tags or the Amazon S3 bucket permissions from the source AMI to the new AMI. Thus, in
       this case by default Stefano will not have access to the AMI in the US West region.

   QUESTION NO: 200

       A user has created a VPC with a subnet and a security group. The user has launched an instance
       in that subnet and attached a public IP. The user is still unable to connect to the instance.
       The internet gateway has also been created. What can be the reason for the error?

       A. The internet gateway is not configured with the route table
       B. The private IP is not present
       C. The outbound traffic on the security group is disabled
       D. The internet gateway is not configured with the security group

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC. is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. AWS
       provides two features the user can use to increase security in VPC: security groups and network
       ACLs. Security groups work at the instance level. When a user launches an instance and wants to
       connect to an instance, he needs an internet gateway. The internet gateway should be configured
       with the route table to allow traffic from the internet.

   QUESTION NO: 201

       A user is trying to setup a security policy for ELB. The user wants ELB to meet the cipher
       supported by the client by configuring the server order preference in ELB security policy. Which of
       the below mentioned preconfigured policies supports this feature?

       A. ELBSecurity Policy-2014-01
       B. ELBSecurity Policy-2011-08
       C. ELBDefault Negotiation Policy
       D. ELBSample- OpenSSLDefault Cipher Policy

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       Elastic Load Balancing uses a Secure Socket Layer (SSL. negotiation configuration which
       is known as a Security Policy. It is used to negotiate the SSL connections between a client and
       the loadbalancer. If the load balancer is configured to support the Server Order Preference, then
       load balancer gets to select the first cipher in its list that matches any one of the ciphers in
       client's list. When the user verifies the preconfigured policies supported by ELB, the policy
       “ELBSecurity Policy-2014-01” supports server order preference.

   QUESTION NO: 202

       A user has configured ELB with Auto Scaling. The user suspended the Auto Scaling AlarmNotification
       (which notifies Auto Scaling for CloudWatch alarms. process for a while. What will Auto Scaling do
       during this period?

       A. AWS will not receive the alarms from CloudWatch
       B. AWS will receive the alarms but will not execute the Auto Scaling policy
       C. Auto Scaling will execute the policy but it will not launch the instances until the process is
          resumed
       D. It is not possible to suspend the AlarmNotification process

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       Auto Scaling performs various processes, such as Launch, Terminate Alarm Notification etc. The
       user can also suspend individual process. The AlarmNotification process type accepts notifications
       from the Amazon CloudWatch alarms that are associated with the Auto Scaling group. If the user
       suspends this process type, Auto Scaling will not automatically execute the scaling policies that
       would be triggered by the alarms.

       George has launched three EC2 instances inside the US-East-1a zone with his AWS account. Ray
       has launched two EC2 instances in the US-East-1a zone with his AWS account. Which of the below
       entioned statements will help George and Ray understand the availability zone (AZ. concept
       better?

       A. The instances of George and Ray will be running in the same data centre
       B. All the instances of George and Ray can communicate over a private IP with a minimal cost
       C. All the instances of George and Ray can communicate over a private IP without any cost
       D. The US-East-1a region of George and Ray can be different availability zones

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       Each AWS region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones. To ensure that the
       AWS resources are distributed across the Availability Zones for a region, AWS independently maps the
       Availability Zones to identifiers for each account. In this case the Availability Zone US-East-1a
       where George’s EC2 instances are running might not be the same location as the US-East-1a
       zone of Ray’s EC2 instances. There is no way for the user to coordinate the Availability Zones
       between accounts.

       A user had aggregated the CloudWatch metric data on the AMI ID. The user observed some
       abnormal behaviour of the CPU utilization metric while viewing the last 2 weeks of data. The user
       wants to share that data with his manager. How can the user achieve this easily with the AWS console?

       A. The user can use the copy URL functionality of CloudWatch to share the exact details
       B. The user can use the export data option from the CloudWatch console to export the
          current data point
       C. The user has to find the period and data and provide all the aggregation information to
          the manager
       D. The user can use the CloudWatch data copy functionality to copy the current data points

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       Amazon CloudWatch provides the functionality to graph the metric data generated either by the
       AWS services or the custom metric to make it easier for the user to analyse. The console
       provides the option to save the URL or bookmark it so that it can be used in the future by typing
       the same URL. The Copy URL functionality is available under the console when the user selects
       any metric to view.


   QUESTION NO: 205

       A user has setup a CloudWatch alarm on the EC2 instance for CPU utilization. The user has
       setup to receive a notification on email when the CPU utilization is higher than 60%. The user is
       running a virus scan on the same instance at a particular time. The user wants to avoid receiving
       an email at this time. What should the user do?

       A. Remove the alarm
       B. Disable the alarm for a while using CLI
       C. Modify the CPU utilization by removing the email alert
       D. Disable the alarm for a while using the console

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       Amazon CloudWatch alarm watches a single metric over a time period that the user specifies
       and performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold
       over a number of time periods. When the user has setup an alarm and it is know that for some
       unavoidable event the status may change to Alarm, the user can disable the alarm using the
       DisableAlarmActions API or from the command line mon-disable-alarm-actions.

   QUESTION NO: 207

       A user has created a VPC with the public and private subnets using the VPC wizard. The VPC has
       CIDR 20.0.0.0/16. The public subnet uses CIDR 20.0.1.0/24. The user is planning to host a web server
       in the public subnet (port 80. and a DB server in the private subnet (port 3306.. The user is
       configuring a security group for the public subnet (WebSecGrp. and the private subnet(DBSecGrp).
       Which of the below mentioned entries is required in the private subnet database security 
       group (DBSecGrp)?

       A. Allow Inbound on port 3306 for Source Web Server Security Group (WebSecGrp.
       B. Allow Inbound on port 3306 from source 20.0.0.0/16
       C. Allow Outbound on port 3306 for Destination Web Server Security Group (WebSecGrp.
       D. Allow Outbound on port 80 for Destination NAT Instance IP

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       A user can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. If the user has
       created a public private subnet to host the web server and DB server respectively, the user should
       configure that the instances in the private subnet can receive inbound traffic from the public
       subnet on the DB port. Thus, configure port 3306 in Inbound with the source as the Web Server
       Security Group (WebSecGrp.. The user should configure ports 80 and 443 for Destination
       0.0.0.0/0 as the route table directs traffic to the NAT instance from the private subnet.

   QUESTION NO: 208

       A user has created a VPC with CIDR 20.0.0.0/16 using the wizard. The user has created public
       and VPN only subnets along with hardware VPN access to connect to the user’s data centre. The
       user has not yet launched any instance as well as modified or deleted any setup. He wants to
       delete this VPC from the console. Will the console allow the user to delete the VPC?

       A. Yes, the console will delete all the setups and also delete the virtual private gateway
       B. No, the console will ask the user to manually detach the virtual private gateway first and
          then allow deleting the VPC
       C. Yes, the console will delete all the setups and detach the virtual private gateway
       D. No, since the NAT instance is running

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       The user can create subnets as per the requirement within a VPC. If the user wants to connect
       VPC from his own data centre, he can setup a public and VPN only subnet which uses hardware
       VPN access to connect with his data centre. When the user has configured this setup with
       Wizard, it will create a virtual private gateway to route all traffic of the VPN subnet. If the virtual
       private gateway is attached with VPC and the user deletes the VPC from the console it will first
       detach the gateway automatically and only then delete the VPC.

   QUESTION NO: 209

       A user is trying to create a PIOPS EBS volume with 4000 IOPS and 100 GB size. AWS does not
       allow the user to create this volume. What is the possible root cause for this?

       A. The ratio between IOPS and the EBS volume is higher than 30
       B. The maximum IOPS supported by EBS is 3000
       C. The ratio between IOPS and the EBS volume is lower than 50
       D. PIOPS is supported for EBS higher than 500 GB size

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       A provisioned IOPS EBS volume can range in size from 10 GB to 1 TB and the user can provision
       up to 4000 IOPS per volume. The ratio of IOPS provisioned to the volume size requested should
       be a maximum of 30; for example, a volume with 3000 IOPS must be at least 100 GB.

       A user has setup a custom application which generates a number in decimals. The user wants to
       track that number and setup the alarm whenever the number is above a certain limit. The
       application is sending the data to CloudWatch at regular intervals for this purpose. Which of the
       below mentioned statements is not true with respect to the above scenario?

       A. The user can get the aggregate data of the numbers generated over a minute and send it to
          CloudWatch
       B. The user has to supply the timezone with each data point
       C. CloudWatch will not truncate the number until it has an exponent larger than 126 (i.e. 
          (1 x 10^126) ).
       D. The user can create a file in the JSON format with the metric name and value and supply it
          to CloudWatch

       A user has launched an EC2 Windows instance from an instance store backed AMI. The user has
       also set the Instance initiated shutdown behavior to stop. What will happen when the user shuts
       down the OS?

       A. It will not allow the user to shutdown the OS when the shutdown behaviour is set to Stop
       B. It is not possible to set the termination behaviour to Stop for an Instance store backed
          AMI instance
       C. The instance will stay running but the OS will be shutdown
       D. The instance will be terminated

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       When the EC2 instance is launched from an instance store backed AMI, it will not allow the user
       to configure the shutdown behaviour to “Stop”. It gives a warning that the instance does not have
       the EBS root volume.

       A user has enabled versioning on an S3 bucket. The user is using server side encryption for data
       at Rest. If the user is supplying his own keys for encryption (SSE-C., which of the below
       mentioned statements is true?

       A. The user should use the same encryption key for all versions of the same object
       B. It is possible to have different encryption keys for different versions of the same object
       C. AWS S3 does not allow the user to upload his own keys for server side encryption
       D. The SSE-C does not work when versioning is enabled

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       AWS S3 supports client side or server side encryption to encrypt all data at rest. The server side
       encryption can either have the S3 supplied AES-256 encryption key or the user can send the key
       along with each API call to supply his own encryption key (SSE-C.. If the bucket is versioningenabled,
       each object version uploaded by the user using the SSE-C feature can have its own encryption key.
       The user is responsible for tracking which encryption key was used for which object's version

       A user has created a VPC with CIDR 20.0.0.0/16. The user has created one subnet with CIDR
       20.0.0.0/16 in this VPC. The user is trying to create another subnet with the same VPC for
       CIDR 20.0.0.1/24. What will happen in this scenario?

       A. The VPC will modify the first subnet CIDR automatically to allow the second subnet IP range
       B. It is not possible to create a subnet with the same CIDR as VPC
       C. The second subnet will be created
       D. It will throw a CIDR overlaps error

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC. is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. A user
       can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. The user can create a
       subnet with the same size of VPC. However, he cannot create any other subnet since the CIDR of
       the second subnet will conflict with the first subnet.

       scaling of instance storage during maintenance window. What is the correct order of events
       during maintenance window?
       Perform maintenance on standby
       Promote standby to primary
       Perform maintenance on original primary
       Promote original master back as primary

       A. 1, 2, 3, 4
       B. 1, 2, 3
       C. 2, 3, 1, 4

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       Running MySQL on the RDS DB instance as a Multi-AZ deployment can help the user reduce the
       impact of a maintenance event, as the Amazon will conduct maintenance by following the steps in
       the below mentioned order:

       A sys admin is using server side encryption with AWS S3. Which of the below mentioned 
       statements helps the user understand the S3 encryption functionality?

       A. The server side encryption with the user supplied key works when versioning is enabled
       B. The user can use the AWS console, SDK and APIs to encrypt or decrypt the content for
          server side encryption with the user supplied key.
       C. The user must send an AES-128 encrypted key
       D. The user can upload his own encryption key to the S3 console

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       AWS S3 supports client side or server side encryption to encrypt all data at rest. The server side
       encryption can either have the S3 supplied AES-256 encryption key or the user can send the key
       along with each API call to supply his own encryption key. The encryption with the user supplied
       key (SSE-C. does not work with the AWS console. The S3 does not store the keys and the user
       has to send a key with each request. The SSE-C works when the user has enabled versioning.

   QUESTION NO: 216

       A root account owner is trying to understand the S3 bucket ACL. Which of the below mentioned
       options cannot be used to grant ACL on the object using the authorized predefined group?

       A. Authenticated user group
       B. All users group
       C. Log Delivery Group
       D. Canonical user group

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       An S3 bucket ACL grantee can be an AWS account or one of the predefined Amazon S3
       groups. Amazon S3 has a set of predefined groups. When granting account access to a group,
       the user can specify one of the URLs of that group instead of a canonical user ID. AWS S3 has
       the following predefined groups:
       Authenticated Users group: It represents all AWS accounts. All Users group: Access permission to
       this group allows anyone to access the resource. Log Delivery group: WRITE permission on a
       bucket enables this group to write server access logs to the bucket.

       A user has created a VPC with CIDR 20.0.0.0/16 using the wizard. The user has created a public
       subnet CIDR (20.0.0.0/24. and VPN only subnets CIDR (20.0.1.0/24. along with the VPN
       gateway (vgw-12345. to connect to the user’s data centre. The user’s data centre has CIDR
       172.28.0.0/12. The user has also setup a NAT instance (i-123456. to allow traffic to the internet
       from the VPN subnet. Which of the below mentioned options is not a valid entry for the main
       route table in this scenario?

       A. Destination: 20.0.1.0/24 and Target: i-12345
       B. Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 and Target: i-12345
       C. Destination: 172.28.0.0/12 and Target: vgw-12345
       D. Destination: 20.0.0.0/16 and Target: local

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       The user can create subnets as per the requirement within a VPC. If the user wants to connect
       VPC from his own data centre, he can setup a public and VPN only subnet which uses hardware
       VPN access to connect with his data centre. When the user has configured this setup with
       Wizard, it will create a virtual private gateway to route all traffic of the VPN subnet. If the user has
       setup a NAT instance to route all the internet requests then all requests to the internet should be
       routed to it. All requests to the organization’s DC will be routed to the VPN gateway.
       Here are the valid entries for the main route table in this scenario:
       Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 & Target: i-12345 (To route all internet traffic to the NAT Instance.
       Destination: 172.28.0.0/12 & Target: vgw-12345 (To route all the organization’s data centre traffic
       to the VPN gateway.
       Destination: 20.0.0.0/16 & Target: local (To allow local routing in VPC.

   QUESTION NO: 218

       A user has created a VPC with public and private subnets using the VPC wizard. The VPC has
       CIDR 20.0.0.0/16. The private subnet uses CIDR 20.0.0.0/24 . The NAT instance ID is i-a12345.
       Which of the below mentioned entries are required in the main route table attached with the
       private subnet to allow instances to connect with the internet?

       A. Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 and Target: i-a12345
       B. Destination: 20.0.0.0/0 and Target: 80
       C. Destination: 20.0.0.0/0 and Target: i-a12345
       D. Destination: 20.0.0.0/24 and Target: i-a12345

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       A user can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. If the user has
       created a public private subnet, the instances in the public subnet can receive inbound traffic
       directly from the Internet, whereas the instances in the private subnet cannot. If these subnets are
       created with Wizard, AWS will create two route tables and attach to the subnets. The main route
       table will have the entry “Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 and Target: ia12345”, which allows all the
       instances in the private subnet to connect to the internet using NAT.

       A root account owner has given full access of his S3 bucket to one of the IAM users using the
       bucket ACL. When the IAM user logs in to the S3 console, which actions can he perform?

       A. He can just view the content of the bucket
       B. He can do all the operations on the bucket
       C. It is not possible to give access to an IAM user using ACL
       D. The IAM user can perform all operations on the bucket using only API/SDK

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       Each AWS S3 bucket and object has an ACL (Access Control List. associated with it. An ACL is a
       list of grants identifying the grantee and the permission granted. The user can use ACLs to grant
       basic read/write permissions to other AWS accounts. ACLs use an Amazon S3–specific XML
       schema. The user cannot grant permissions to other users (IAM users. in his account.

   QUESTION NO: 220

       An organization has configured Auto Scaling with ELB. There is a memory issue in the application
       which is causing CPU utilization to go above 90%. The higher CPU usage triggers an event for
       Auto Scaling as per the scaling policy. If the user wants to find the root cause inside the
       application without triggering a scaling activity, how can he achieve this?

       A. Stop the scaling process until research is completed
       B. It is not possible to find the root cause from that instance without triggering scaling
       C. Delete Auto Scaling until research is completed
       D. Suspend the scaling process until research is completed

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       Auto Scaling allows the user to suspend and then resume one or more of the Auto Scaling
       processes in the Auto Scaling group. This is very useful when the user wants to investigate a
       configuration problem or some other issue, such as a memory leak with the web application and
       then make changes to the application, without triggering the Auto Scaling process.

       A sys admin is planning to subscribe to the RDS event notifications. For which of the below
       mentioned source categories the subscription cannot be configured?

       A. DB security group
       B. DB snapshot
       C. DB options group
       D. DB parameter group

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       Amazon RDS uses the Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS. to provide a notification when
       an Amazon RDS event occurs. These events can be configured for source categories, such as
       DB instance, DB security group, DB snapshot and DB parameter group.

       A user has launched an EC2 instance. The instance got terminated as soon as it was launched.
       Which of the below mentioned options is not a possible reason for this?

       A. The user account has reached the maximum EC2 instance limit
       B. The snapshot is corrupt
       C. The AMI is missing. It is the required part
       D. The user account has reached the maximum volume limit

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       When the user account has reached the maximum number of EC2 instances, it will not be
       allowed to launch an instance. AWS will throw an ‘InstanceLimitExceeded’ error. For all other
       reasons, such as “AMI is missing part”, “Corrupt Snapshot” or ”Volume limit has reached” it will
       launch an EC2 instance and then terminate it.

       A user is trying to understand the detailed CloudWatch monitoring concept. Which of the
       below mentioned services does not provide detailed monitoring with CloudWatch?

       A. AWS EMR
       B. AWS RDS
       C. AWS ELB
       D. AWS Route53

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS as well as the custom services. It provides either basic or
       detailed monitoring for the supported AWS products. In basic monitoring, a service sends data points
       to CloudWatch every five minutes, while in detailed monitoring a service sends data points to
       CloudWatch every minute. Services, such as RDS, EC2, Auto Scaling, ELB, and Route 53 can
       provide the monitoring data every minute.

   QUESTION NO: 224

       A user is measuring the CPU utilization of a private data centre machine every minute. The
       machine provides the aggregate of data every hour, such as Sum of data”, “Min value”, “Max
       value, and “Number of Data points”.
       The user wants to send these values to CloudWatch. How can the user achieve this?

       A. Send the data using the put-metric-data command with the aggregate-values parameter
       B. Send the data using the put-metric-data command with the average-values parameter
       C. Send the data using the put-metric-data command with the statistic-values parameter
       D. Send the data using the put-metric-data command with the aggregate –data parameter

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       AWS CloudWatch supports the custom metrics. The user can always capture the custom data
       and upload the data to CloudWatch using CLI or APIs. The user can publish the data to
       CloudWatch as single data points or as an aggregated set of data points called a statistic set
       using the command put-metric-data. When sending the aggregate data, the user needs to send it
       with the parameter statistic-values:
       awscloudwatch put-metric-data --metric-name <Name> --namespace <Custom namespace> --
       timestamp
       <UTC Format> --statistic-values Sum=XX,Minimum=YY,Maximum=AA,SampleCount=BB --unit
       Milliseconds

   QUESTION NO: 225

       A user has enabled detailed CloudWatch monitoring with the AWS Simple Notification Service.
       Which of the below mentioned statements helps the user understand detailed monitoring better?

       A. SNS will send data every minute after configuration
       B. There is no need to enable since SNS provides data every minute
       C. AWS CloudWatch does not support monitoring for SNS
       D. SNS cannot provide data every minute

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS as well as the custom services. It provides either basic or
       detailed monitoring for the supported AWS products. In basic monitoring, a service sends data
       points to CloudWatch every five minutes, while in detailed monitoring a service sends data points
       to CloudWatch every minute. The AWS SNS service sends data every 5 minutes. Thus, it supports
       only the basic monitoring. The user cannot enable detailed monitoring with SNS.

       A user has setup a VPC with CIDR 20.0.0.0/16. The VPC has a private subnet (20.0.1.0/24) and a
       public subnet (20.0.0.0/240). The user’s data centre has CIDR of 20.0.54.0/24 and 20.1.0.0/24 If the
       private subnet wants to communicate with the data centre, what will happen?

       A. It will allow traffic communication on both the CIDRs of the data centre
       B. It will not allow traffic with data centre on CIDR 20.1.0.0/24 but allows traffic communication on
          20.0.54.0/24
       C. It will not allow traffic communication on any of the data centre CIDRs
       D. It will allow traffic with data centre on CIDR 20.1.0.0/24 but does not allow on 20.0.54.0/24

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       VPC allows the user to set up a connection between his VPC and corporate or home network
       data centre. If the user has an IP address prefix in the VPC that overlaps with one of the
       networks' prefixes, any traffic to the network's prefix is dropped. In this case CIDR 20.0.54.0/24
       falls in the VPC’s CIDR range of 20.0.0.0/16. Thus, it will not allow traffic on that IP. In the case of
       20.1.0.0/24, it does not fall in the VPC’s CIDR range. Thus, traffic will be allowed on it.

       A user wants to find the particular error that occurred on a certain date in the AWS MySQL RDS
       DB. Which of the below mentioned activities may help the user to get the data easily?

       A. It is not possible to get the log files for MySQL RDS
       B. Find all the transaction logs and query on those records
       C. Direct the logs to the DB table and then query that table
       D. Download the log file to DynamoDB and search for the record

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       The user can view, download, and watch the database logs using the Amazon RDS console, the
       Command Line Interface (CLI. or the Amazon RDS API. For the MySQL RDS, the user can view
       the error log, slow query log, and general logs. The user can also view the MySQL logs easily by
       directing the logs to a database table in the main database and querying that table.

       A user is trying to send custom metrics to CloudWatch using the PutMetricData APIs. Which of the
       below mentioned points should the user needs to take care while sending the data to CloudWatch?

       A. The size of a request is limited to 8KB for HTTP GET requests and 40KB for HTTP
          POST requests
       B. The size of a request is limited to 128KB for HTTP GET requests and 64KB for HTTP
          POST requests
       C. The size of a request is limited to 40KB for HTTP GET requests and 8KB for HTTP
          POST requests
       D. The size of a request is limited to 16KB for HTTP GET requests and 80KB for HTTP
          POST requests

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       With AWS CloudWatch, the user can publish data points for a metric that share not only the
       same time stamp, but also the same namespace and dimensions. CloudWatch can accept
       multiple data points in the same PutMetricData call with the same time stamp. The only thing that
       the user needs to take care of is that the size of a PutMetricData request is limited to 8KB for
       HTTP GET requests and 40KB for HTTP POST requests.

   QUESTION NO: 229

       An AWS account owner has setup multiple IAM users. One IAM user only has CloudWatch access.
       He has setup the alarm action which stops the EC2 instances when the CPU utilization is
       below the threshold limit. What will happen in this case?

       A. It is not possible to stop the instance using the CloudWatch alarm
       B. CloudWatch will stop the instance when the action is executed
       C. The user cannot set an alarm on EC2 since he does not have the permission
       D. The user can setup the action but it will not be executed if the user does not have EC2 rights

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       Amazon CloudWatch alarms watch a single metric over a time period that the user specifies and
       performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over
       a number of time periods. The user can setup an action which stops the instances when their
       CPU utilization is below a certain threshold for a certain period of time. The EC2 action can either
       terminate or stop the instance as part of the EC2 action. If the IAM user has read/write
       permissions for Amazon CloudWatch but not for Amazon EC2, he can still create an alarm.
       However, the stop or terminate actions will not be performed on the Amazon EC2 instance.

       A user has configured ELB with Auto Scaling. The user suspended the Auto Scaling terminate
       process only for a while. What will happen to the availability zone rebalancing process
       (AZRebalance. during this period?

       A. Auto Scaling will not launch or terminate any instances
       B. Auto Scaling will allow the instances to grow more than the maximum size
       C. Auto Scaling will keep launching instances till the maximum instance size
       D. It is not possible to suspend the terminate process while keeping the launch active

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       Auto Scaling performs various processes, such as Launch, Terminate, Availability
       Zone Rebalance (AZRebalance. etc. The AZRebalance process type seeks to maintain a balanced number
       of instances across Availability Zones within a region. If the user suspends the Terminate process,
       the AZRebalance process can cause the Auto Scaling group to grow up to ten percent larger than
       the maximum size. This is because Auto Scaling allows groups to temporarily grow larger than the
       maximum size during rebalancing activities. If Auto Scaling cannot terminate instances, the Auto
       Scaling group could remain up to ten percent larger than the maximum size until the user
       resumes the Terminate process type.

   QUESTION NO: 231

       A user has created a mobile application which makes calls to DynamoDB to fetch certain data.
       The application is using the DynamoDB SDK and root account access/secret access key to
       connect to DynamoDB from mobile. Which of the below mentioned statements is true with respect
       to the best practice for security in this scenario?

       A. The user should create a separate IAM user for each mobile application and
          provide DynamoDB access with it.
       B. The user should create an IAM role with DynamoDB and EC2 access. Attach the role with
          EC2 and route all calls from the mobile through EC2.
       C. The application should use an IAM role with web identity federation which validates calls
          to DynamoDB with identity providers, such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook.
       D. Create an IAM Role with DynamoDB access and attach it with the mobile application

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       With AWS IAM a user is creating an application which runs on an EC2 instance and makes
       requests to AWS, such as DynamoDB or S3 calls. Here it is recommended that the user should
       not create an IAM user and pass the user's credentials to the application or embed those
       credentials inside the application. If the user is creating an app that runs on a mobile phone and
       makes requests to AWS, the user should not create an IAMuser and distribute the user's access
       key with the app. Instead, he should use an identity provider, such as Login with Amazon,
       Facebook, or Google to authenticate the users, and then use that identity to get temporary
       security credentials.

   QUESTION NO: 232

       A user is configuring the Multi AZ feature of an RDS DB. The user came to know that this RDS
       DB does not use the AWS technology, but uses server mirroring to achieve HA. Which DB is the
       user using right now?

       A. My SQL
       B. Oracle
       C. MS SQL
       D. PostgreSQL

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       Amazon RDS provides high availability and failover support for DB instances using Multi AZ
       deployments. In a Multi AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a
       synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone. Multi AZ deployments for Oracle,
       PostgreSQL, and MySQL DB instances use Amazon technology, while SQL Server (MS SQL.
       DB instances use SQL Server Mirroring.

   QUESTION NO: 233

       A user is receiving a notification from the RDS DB whenever there is a change in the DB security
       group. The user does not want to receive these notifications for only a month. Thus, he does not
       want to delete the notification. How can the user configure this?

       A. Change the Disable button for notification to “Yes” in the RDS console
       B. Set the send mail flag to false in the DB event notification console
       C. The only option is to delete the notification from the console
       D. Change the Enable button for notification to “No” in the RDS console

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       Amazon RDS uses the Amazon Simple Notification Service to provide a notification when an
       Amazon RDS event occurs. Event notifications are sent to the addresses that the user has
       provided while creating the subscription. The user can easily turn off the notification without
       deleting a subscription by setting the Enabled radio button to No in the Amazon RDS console or
       by setting the Enabled parameter to false using the CLI or Amazon RDS API.

   QUESTION NO: 234

       A user has created a VPC with CIDR 20.0.0.0/16. The user has created one subnet with CIDR
       20.0.0.0/16 by mistake. The user is trying to create another subnet of CIDR 20.0.0.1/24. How can
       the user create the second subnet?

       A. There is no need to update the subnet as VPC automatically adjusts the CIDR of the
          first subnet based on the second subnet’s CIDR
       B. The user can modify the first subnet CIDR from the console
       C. It is not possible to create a second subnet as one subnet with the same CIDR as the VPC
          has been created
       D. The user can modify the first subnet CIDR with AWS CLI

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC. is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. A user can
       create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside the subnet. The user can create a subnet
       with the same size of VPC. However, he cannot create any other subnet since the CIDR of the
       second subnet will conflict with the first subnet. The user cannot modify the CIDR of a subnet once
       it is created. Thus, in this case if required, the user has to delete the subnet and create new
       subnets.

   QUESTION NO: 235

       A user has created a VPC with the public and private subnets using the VPC wizard. The VPC has
       CIDR 20.0.0.0/16. The public subnet uses CIDR 20.0.1.0/24. The user is planning to host a web server
       in the public subnet (port 80. and a DB server in the private subnet (port 3306.. The user is
       configuring a security group for the public subnet (WebSecGrp. and the private subnet
       (DBSecGrp.. Which of the below mentioned entries is required in the web server security group
       (WebSecGrp.?

       A. Configure Destination as DB Security group ID (DbSecGrp. for port 3306 Outbound
       B. 80 for Destination 0.0.0.0/0 Outbound
       C. Configure port 3306 for source 20.0.0.0/24 InBound
       D. Configure port 80 InBound for source 20.0.0.0/16

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       A user can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. If the user has
       created a public private subnet to host the web server and DB server respectively, the user should
       configure that the instances in the public subnet can receive inbound traffic directly from the
       internet. Thus, the user should configure port 80 with source 0.0.0.0/0 in InBound. The user
       should configure that the instance in the public subnet can send traffic to the private subnet
       instances on the DB port. Thus, the user should configure the DB security group of the private
       subnet (DbSecGrp. as the destination for port 3306 in Outbound.

   QUESTION NO: 236

       A user is trying to understand the detailed CloudWatch monitoring concept. Which of the below
       mentioned services provides detailed monitoring with CloudWatch without charging the user
       extra?

       A. AWS Auto Scaling
       B. AWS Route 53
       C. AWS EMR
       D. AWS SNS

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS as well as the custom services. It provides either basic or
       detailed monitoring for the supported AWS products. In basic monitoring, a service sends data 
       points to CloudWatch every five minutes, while in detailed monitoring a service sends data points
       to CloudWatch every minute. Services, such as RDS, ELB, OpsWorks, and Route 53 can provide
       the monitoring data every minute without charging the user.

   QUESTION NO: 237

       A user is trying to understand the CloudWatch metrics for the AWS services. It is required that
       the user should first understand the namespace for the AWS services. Which of the below
       mentioned is not a valid namespace for the AWS services?

       A. AWS/StorageGateway
       B. AWS/CloudTrail
       C. AWS/ElastiCache
       D. AWS/SWF

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       Amazon CloudWatch is basically a metrics repository. The AWS product puts metrics into this
       repository, and the user can retrieve the data or statistics based on those metrics. To distinguish
       the data for each service, the CloudWatch metric has a namespace. Namespaces are containers
       for metrics. All AWS services that provide the Amazon CloudWatch data use a namespace
       string, beginning with "AWS/". All the services which are supported by CloudWatch will have
       some namespace. CloudWatch does not monitor CloudTrail. Thus, the namespace
       “AWS/CloudTrail” is incorrect.

       A system admin is planning to encrypt all objects being uploaded to S3 from an application. The
       system admin does not want to implement his own encryption algorithm; instead he is planning to
       use server side encryption by supplying his own key (SSE-C.. Which parameter is not required
       while making a call for SSE-C?

       A. x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-AES-256
       B. x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key
       C. x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
       D. x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       AWS S3 supports client side or server side encryption to encrypt all data at rest. The server side
       encryption can either have the S3 supplied AES-256 encryption key or the user can send the key
       along with each API call to supply his own encryption key (SSE-C.. When the user is supplying
       his own encryption key, the user has to send the below mentioned parameters as a part of the
       API calls:
       x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm: Specifies the encryption algorithm
       x-amzserver-side-encryption-customer-key: To provide the base64-encoded encryption key
       x-amzserver-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5: To provide the base64-encoded 128-bit MD5
       digest of the encryption key

       A. SendMessageBatch
       B. DeleteMessageBatch
       C. CreateQueue
       D. DeleteMessageQueue

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS. is a fast, reliable, scalable, and fully managed message
       queuing service. SQS provides a simple and cost-effective way to decouple the components of an
       application. The user can perform the following set of operations using the Amazon SQS:
       CreateQueue, ListQueues, DeleteQueue, SendMessage, SendMessageBatch, ReceiveMessage,
       DeleteMessage, DeleteMessageBatch, ChangeMessageVisibility, ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch,
       SetQueueAttributes, GetQueueAttributes, GetQueueUrl, AddPermission and RemovePermission.
       Operations can be performed only by the AWS account owner or an AWS account that the

   QUESTION NO: 240

       A user has configured Auto Scaling with 3 instances. The user had created a new AMI after
       updating one of the instances. If the user wants to terminate two specific instances to ensure that
       Auto Scaling launches an instances with the new launch configuration, which command should he
       run?

       A. as-delete-instance-in-auto-scaling-group <Instance ID> --no-decrement-desired-capacity
       B. as-terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group <Instance ID> --update-desired-capacity
       C. as-terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group <Instance ID> --decrement-desired-capacity
       D. as-terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group <Instance ID> --no-decrement-desired-capacity

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       The Auto Scaling command as-terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group <Instance ID>
       will terminate the specific instance ID. The user is required to specify the parameter as
       –no-decrement-desiredcapacity to ensure that it launches a new instance from the launch config
       after terminating the instance. If the user specifies the parameter --decrement-desired-capacity
       then Auto Scaling will terminate the instance and decrease the desired capacity by 1.

   QUESTION NO: 241

       A user has launched an EC2 instance from an instance store backed AMI. If the user restarts the
       instance, what will happen to the ephermal storage data?

       A. All the data will be erased but the ephermal storage will stay connected
       B. All data will be erased and the ephermal storage is released
       C. It is not possible to restart an instance launched from an instance store backed AMI
       D. The data is preserved

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       A user can reboot an EC2 instance using the AWS console, the Amazon EC2 CLI or the
       Amazon EC2 API. Rebooting an instance is equivalent to rebooting an operating system.
       However, it is recommended that the user use Amazon EC2 to reboot the instance instead of
       running the operating system reboot command from the instance. When an instance launched
       from an instance store backed AMI is rebooted all the ephermal storage data is still preserved.

   QUESTION NO: 242

       A user has launched an EC2 instance. However, due to some reason the instance was terminated.
       If the user wants to find out the reason for termination, where can he find the details?

       A. It is not possible to find the details after the instance is terminated
       B. The user can get information from the AWS console, by checking the Instance
          description under the State transition reason label
       C. The user can get information from the AWS console, by checking the Instance
          description under the Instance Status Change reason label
       D. The user can get information from the AWS console, by checking the Instance
          description under the Instance Termination reason label

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       An EC2 instance, once terminated, may be available in the AWS console for a while after
       termination. The user can find the details about the termination from the description tab under the
       label State transition reason. If the instance is still running, there will be no reason listed. If the user
       has explicitly stopped or terminated the instance, the reason will be “User initiated shutdown”.

   QUESTION NO: 243

       A user has created a VPC with CIDR 20.0.0.0/24. The user has used all the IPs of CIDR and
       wants to increase the size of the VPC. The user has two subnets: public (20.0.0.0/28. and private
       (20.0.1.0/28). How can the user change the size of the VPC?

       A. The user can delete all the instances of the subnet. Change the size of the subnets
          to 20.0.0.0/32 and 20.0.1.0/32, respectively. Then the user can increase the size of the VPC using CLI
       B. It is not possible to change the size of the VPC once it has been created
       C. The user can add a subnet with a higher range so that it will automatically increase the size of the
          VPC.
       D. The user can delete the subnets first and then modify the size of the VPC

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       Once the user has created a VPC, he cannot change the CIDR of that VPC. The user has to terminate
       all the instances, delete the subnets and then delete the VPC. Create a new VPC with a higher size
       and launch instances with the newly created VPC and subnets.

   QUESTION NO: 244

       A user has configured ELB with SSL using a security policy for secure negotiation between the
       client and load balancer. Which of the below mentioned security policies is supported by ELB?

       A. Dynamic Security Policy
       B. All the other options
       C. Predefined Security Policy
       D. Default Security Policy

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       Elastic Load Balancing uses a Secure Socket Layer (SSL. negotiation configuration which is
       known as a Security Policy. It is used to negotiate the SSL connections between a client and the
       loadbalancer. ELB supports two policies:
       Predefined Security Policy: which comes with predefined cipher and SSL protocols;
       Custom Security Policy: which allows the user to configure a policy.

   QUESTION NO: 245

       A user has granted read/write permission of his S3 bucket using ACL. Which of the below
       mentioned options is a valid ID to grant permission to other AWS accounts (grantee. using ACL?

       A. IAM User ID
       B. S3 Secure ID
       C. Access ID
       D. Canonical user ID

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       An S3 bucket ACL grantee can be an AWS account or one of the predefined Amazon S3
       groups. The user can grant permission to an AWS account by the email address of that account
       or by the canonical user ID. If the user provides an email in the grant request, Amazon S3 finds
       the canonical user ID for that account and adds it to the ACL. The resulting ACL will always
       contain the canonical user ID for the AWS account, and not the AWS account's email address.

   QUESTION NO: 246

       A user has configured an ELB to distribute the traffic among multiple instances. The user
       instances are facing some issues due to the back-end servers. Which of the below
       mentioned CloudWatch metrics helps the user understand the issue with the instances?

       A. HTTPCode_Backend_3XX
       B. HTTPCode_Backend_4XX
       C. HTTPCode_Backend_2XX
       D. HTTPCode_Backend_5XX

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS as well as the custom services. For ELB, CloudWatch
       provides various metrics including error code by ELB as well as by back-end servers (instances..
       It gives data for the count of the number of HTTP response codes generated by the back-end
       instances. This metric does not include any response codes generated by the load balancer.
       These metrics are:
       The 2XX class status codes represents successful actions
       The 3XX class status code indicates that the user agent requires action
       The 4XX class status code represents client errors
       The 5XX class status code represents back-end server errors

   QUESTION NO: 247

       A user has launched an EC2 instance store backed instance in the US-East-1a zone. The user
       created AMI #1 and copied it to the Europe region. After that, the user made a few updates to the
       application running in the US-East-1a zone. The user makes an AMI#2 after the changes. If the
       user launches a new instance in Europe from the AMI #1 copy, which of the below mentioned
       statements is true?

       A. The new instance will have the changes made after the AMI copy as AWS just copies the
          reference of the original AMI during the copying. Thus, the copied AMI will have all the 
          updated data.
       B. The new instance will have the changes made after the AMI copy since AWS keeps updating the AMI.
       C. It is not possible to copy the instance store backed AMI from one region to another.
       D. The new instance in the EU region will not have the changes made after the AMI copy.

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       Within EC2, when the user copies an AMI, the new AMI is fully independent of the source AMI;
       there is no link to the original (source. AMI. The user can modify the source AMI without
       affecting the new AMI and vice a versa. Therefore, in this case even if the source AMI is
       modified, the copied AMI of the EU region will not have the changes. Thus, after copy the user
       needs to copy the new source AMI to the destination region to get those changes.

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       When the user creates a new EBS volume and is trying to access it for the first time it will
       encounter reduced IOPS due to wiping or initiating of the block storage. To avoid this as well as
       achieve the best performance it is required to pre warm the EBS volume. For a blank volume
       attached with a Linux OS, the “dd” command is used to write to all the blocks on the device. In
       the command “dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/xvdfbs=1M” the parameter “if =import file” should be set to
       one of the Linux virtual devices, such as /dev/zero. The “of=output file” parameter should be set
       to the drive that the user wishes to warm. The “bs” parameter sets the block size of the write
       operation; for optimal performance, this should be set to 1 MB.

       A user has created an Auto Scaling group using CLI. The user wants to enable CloudWatch
       detailed monitoring for that group. How can the user configure this?

       A. When the user sets an alarm on the Auto Scaling group, it automatically enables detail monitoring
       B. By default detailed monitoring is enabled for Auto Scaling
       C. Auto Scaling does not support detailed monitoring
       D. Enable detail monitoring from the AWS console

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS as well as the custom services. It provides either basic or
       detailed monitoring for the supported AWS products. In basic monitoring, a service sends data
       points to CloudWatch every five minutes, while in detailed monitoring a service sends data
       points to CloudWatch every minute. To enable detailed instance monitoring for a new Auto Scaling
       group, the user does not need to take any extra steps. When the user creates an Auto Scaling
       launch config as the first step for creating an Auto Scaling group, each launch configuration
       contains a flag named InstanceMonitoring.Enabled. The default value of this flag is true. Thus, 
       the user does not need to set this flag if he wants detailed monitoring.

       A user has created a VPC with a public subnet. The user has terminated all the instances which
       are part of the subnet. Which of the below mentioned statements is true with respect to this
       scenario?

       A. The user cannot delete the VPC since the subnet is not deleted
       B. All network interface attached with the instances will be deleted
       C. When the user launches a new instance it cannot use the same subnet
       D. The subnet to which the instances were launched with will be deleted

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC. is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. A user
       can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. When an instance is
       launched it will have a network interface attached with it. The user cannot delete the subnet until
       he terminates the instance and deletes the network interface. When the user terminates the
       instance all the network interfaces attached with it are also deleted.

   QUESTION NO: 251

       A user has configured ELB with SSL using a security policy for secure negotiation between the
       client and load balancer. The ELB security policy supports various ciphers. Which of the below
       mentioned options helps identify the matching cipher at the client side to the ELB cipher list when
       client is requesting ELB DNS over SSL?

       A. Cipher Protocol
       B. Client Configuration Preference
       C. Server Order Preference
       D. Load Balancer Preference

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       Elastic Load Balancing uses a Secure Socket Layer (SSL. negotiation configuration which
       is known as a Security Policy. It is used to negotiate the SSL connections between a client and the
       loadbalancer. When client is requesting ELB DNS over SSL and if the load balancer is configured to 
       support the Server Order Preference, then the load balancer gets to select the first cipher in its
       list that matches any one of the ciphers in the client's list. Server Order Preference ensures that
       the load balancer determines which cipher is used for the SSL connection.

   QUESTION NO: 252

       A user has created a VPC with public and private subnets. The VPC has CIDR 20.0.0.0/16. The
       private subnet uses CIDR 20.0.1.0/24 and the public subnet uses CIDR 20.0.0.0/24. The user is
       planning to host a web server in the public subnet (port 80. and a DB server in the private subnet
       (port 3306.. The user is configuring a security group of the NAT instance. Which of the below
       mentioned entries is not required for the NAT security group?

       A. For Inbound allow Source: 20.0.1.0/24 on port 80
       B. For Outbound allow Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 on port 80
       C. For Inbound allow Source: 20.0.0.0/24 on port 80
       D. For Outbound allow Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 on port 443

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       A user can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. If the user has
       created a public private subnet to host the web server and DB server respectively, the user
       should configure that the instances in the private subnet can connect to the internet using the
       NAT instances. The user should first configure that NAT can receive traffic on ports 80 and 443
       from the private subnet. Thus, allow ports 80 and 443 in Inbound for the private subnet
       20.0.1.0/24. Now to route this traffic to the internet configure ports 80 and 443 in Outbound with
       destination 0.0.0.0/0. The NAT should not have an entry for the public subnet CIDR.

   QUESTION NO: 253

       A user has created an application which will be hosted on EC2. The application makes calls to
       DynamoDB to fetch certain data. The application is using the DynamoDB SDK to connect with
       from the EC2 instance. Which of the below mentioned statements is true with respect to the best
       practice for security in this scenario?

       A. The user should attach an IAM role with DynamoDB access to the EC2 instance
       B. The user should create an IAM user with DynamoDB access and use its credentials within the
          application to connect with DynamoDB
       C. The user should create an IAM role, which has EC2 access so that it will allow deploying
          the application
       D. The user should create an IAM user with DynamoDB and EC2 access. Attach the user with the
          application so that it does not use the root account credentials

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       With AWS IAM a user is creating an application which runs on an EC2 instance and makes
       requests to AWS, such as DynamoDB or S3 calls. Here it is recommended that the user should
       not create an IAM user and pass the user's credentials to the application or embed those
       credentials inside the application. Instead, the user should use roles for EC2 and give that role
       access to DynamoDB /S3. When the roles are attached to EC2, it will give temporary security
       credentials to the application hosted on that EC2, to connect with DynamoDB / S3.

   QUESTION NO: 254

       An organization (Account ID 123412341234. has attached the below mentioned IAM policy to a
       user. What does this policy statement entitle the user to perform?
       {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [{
       "Sid": "AllowUsersAllActionsForCredentials",
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Action": [
       "iam:*LoginProfile",
       "iam:*AccessKey*",
       "iam:*SigningCertificate*"
       ],
       "Resource": ["arn:aws:iam:: 123412341234:user/${aws:username}"]
       }]
       }

       A. The policy allows the IAM user to modify all IAM user’s credentials using the console, SDK,
          CLI or APIs
       B. The policy will give an invalid resource error
       C. The policy allows the IAM user to modify all credentials using only the console
       D. The policy allows the user to modify all IAM user’s password, sign in certificates and access
          keys using only CLI, SDK or APIs

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       WS Identity and Access Management is a web service which allows organizations to manage
       users and user permissions for various AWS services. If the organization (Account ID
       123412341234. wants some of their users to manage credentials (access keys, password, and
       sing in certificates. of all IAM users, they should set an applicable policy to that user or group of
       users. The below mentioned policy allows the IAM user to modify the credentials of all IAM user’s
       using only CLI, SDK or APIs. The user cannot use the AWS console for this activity since he does
       not have list permission for the IAM users.
       {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [{

   QUESTION NO: 255

       A sys admin is trying to understand the sticky session algorithm. Please select the correct
       sequence of steps, both when the cookie is present and when it is not, to help the admin
       understand the implementation of the sticky session:
       ELB inserts the cookie in the response
       ELB chooses the instance based on the load balancing algorithm
       Check the cookie in the service request
       The cookie is found in the request
       The cookie is not found in the request

       A. 3,1,4,2 [Cookie is not Present] & 3,1,5,2 [Cookie is Present]
       B. 3,4,1,2 [Cookie is not Present] & 3,5,1,2 [Cookie is Present]
       C. 3,5,2,1 [Cookie is not Present] & 3,4,2,1 [Cookie is Present]
       D. 3,2,5,4 [Cookie is not Present] & 3,2,4,5 [Cookie is Present]

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       Generally AWS ELB routes each request to a zone with the minimum load. The Elastic Load
       Balancer provides a feature called sticky session which binds the user’s session with a specific
       EC2 instance. The load balancer uses a special load-balancer-generated cookie to track the
       application instance for each request. When the load balancer receives a request, it first checks to
       see if this cookie is present in the request. If so, the request is sent to the application instance
       specified in the cookie. If there is no cookie, the load balancer chooses an application instance
       based on the existing load balancing algorithm. A cookie is inserted into the response for binding
       subsequent requests from the same user to that application instance.

   QUESTION NO: 256

       A user has a weighing plant. The user measures the weight of some goods every 5 minutes and
       sends data to AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and tracking. Which of the below mentioned
       parameters is mandatory for the user to include in the request list?

       A. Value
       B. Namespace
       C. Metric Name
       D. Timezone

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       AWS CloudWatch supports the custom metrics. The user can always capture the custom data and
       upload the data to CloudWatch using CLI or APIs. The user can publish the data to CloudWatch as
       single data points or as an aggregated set of data points called a statistic set. The user has to
       always include the namespace as part of the request. The user can supply a file instead of the
       metric name. If the user does not supply the timezone, it accepts the current time. If the user is
       sending the data as a single data point it will have parameters, such as value. However, if the
       user is sending as an aggregate it will have parameters, such as statistic-values.

   QUESTION NO: 257

       An organization has configured Auto Scaling for hosting their application. The system admin wants
       to understand the Auto Scaling health check process. If the instance is unhealthy, Auto Scaling
       launches an instance and terminates the unhealthy instance. What is the order execution?

       A. Auto Scaling launches a new instance first and then terminates the unhealthy instance
       B. Auto Scaling performs the launch and terminate processes in a random order
       C. Auto Scaling launches and terminates the instances simultaneously
       D. Auto Scaling terminates the instance first and then launches a new instance

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       Auto Scaling keeps checking the health of the instances at regular intervals and marks
       the instance for replacement when it is unhealthy. The ReplaceUnhealthy process terminates 
       instances which are marked as unhealthy and subsequently creates new instances to replace them.
       This process first terminates the instance and then launches a new instance.

   QUESTION NO: 258

       A user is trying to connect to a running EC2 instance using SSH. However, the user gets an Unprotected
       Private Key File error. Which of the below mentioned options can be a possible reason for rejection?

       A. The private key file has the wrong file permission
       B. The ppk file used for SSH is read only
       C. The public key file has the wrong permission
       D. The user has provided the wrong user name for the OS login

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       While doing SSH to an EC2 instance, if you get an Unprotected Private Key File error it means
       that the private key file's permissions on your computer are too open. Ideally the private key
       should have the Unix permission of 0400. To fix that, run the command:
        # chmod 0400 /path/to/private.key

   QUESTION NO: 259

       A user has provisioned 2000 IOPS to the EBS volume. The application hosted on that EBS is
       experiencing less IOPS than provisioned. Which of the below mentioned options does not affect
       the IOPS of the volume?

       A. The application does not have enough IO for the volume
       B. The instance is EBS optimized
       C. The EC2 instance has 10 Gigabit Network connectivity
       D. The volume size is too large

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       When the application does not experience the expected IOPS or throughput of the PIOPS EBS
       volume that was provisioned, the possible root cause could be that the EC2 bandwidth is the
       limiting factor and the instance might not be either EBS-optimized or might not have 10 Gigabit
       network connectivity. Another possible cause for not experiencing the expected IOPS could
       also be that the user is not driving enough I/O to the EBS volumes. The size of the volume may
       not affect IOPS.

   QUESTION NO: 260

       A storage admin wants to encrypt all the objects stored in S3 using server side encryption. The
       user does not want to use the AES 256 encryption key provided by S3. How can the user
       achieve this?

       A. The admin should upload his secret key to the AWS console and let S3 decrypt the objects
       B. The admin should use CLI or API to upload the encryption key to the S3 bucket. When
          making a call to the S3 API mention the encryption key URL in each request
       C. S3 does not support client supplied encryption keys for server side encryption
       D. The admin should send the keys and encryption algorithm with each API call

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       AWS S3 supports client side or server side encryption to encrypt all data at rest. The server side
       encryption can either have the S3 supplied AES-256 encryption key or the user can send the
       key along with each API callto supply his own encryption key. Amazon S3 never stores the
       user’s encryption key. The user has to supply it for each encryption or decryption call.

   QUESTION NO: 261

       A user is trying to create a PIOPS EBS volume with 8 GB size and 200 IOPS. Will AWS create
       the volume?

       A. Yes, since the ratio between EBS and IOPS is less than 30
       B. No, since the PIOPS and EBS size ratio is less than 30
       C. No, the EBS size is less than 10 GB
       D. Yes, since PIOPS is higher than 100

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       A provisioned IOPS EBS volume can range in size from 10 GB to 1 TB and the user can provision
       up to 4000 IOPS per volume. The ratio of IOPS provisioned to the volume size requested should
       be a maximum of 30; for example, a volume with 3000 IOPS must be at least 100 GB.


   QUESTION NO: 262

       A user has scheduled the maintenance window of an RDS DB on Monday at 3 AM. Which of the below
       mentioned events may force to take the DB instance offline during the maintenance window?

       A. Enabling Read Replica
       B. Making the DB Multi AZ
       C. DB password change
       D. Security patching

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       Amazon RDS performs maintenance on the DB instance during a user-definable maintenance
       window. The system may be offline or experience lower performance during that window. The
       only maintenance events that may require RDS to make the DB instance offline are:
       Scaling compute operations Software patching. Required software patching is automatically 
       scheduled only for patches that are security and durability related. Such patching occurs 
       infrequently (typically once every few months. and seldom requires more than a fraction of
       the maintenance window.

   QUESTION NO: 263

       An organization has launched 5 instances: 2 for production and 3 for testing. The organization
       wants that one particular group of IAM users should only access the test instances and not the
       production ones. How can the organization set that as a part of the policy?

       A. Launch the test and production instances in separate regions and allow region wise access
          to the group
       B. Define the IAM policy which allows access based on the instance ID
       C. Create an IAM policy with a condition which allows access to only small instances
       D. Define the tags on the test and production servers and add a condition to the IAM policy
          which allows access to specific tags

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       AWS Identity and Access Management is a web service which allows organizations to manage
       users and user permissions for various AWS services. The user can add conditions as a part of
       the IAM policies. The condition can be set on AWS Tags, Time, and Client IP as well as on various
       parameters. If the organization wants the user to access only specific instances he should define
       proper tags and add to the IAM policy condition. The sample policy is shown below.
       "Statement": [
       {
       "Action": "ec2:*",
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Resource": "*",
       "Condition": {
       "StringEquals": {

   QUESTION NO: 264

       A user has configured Auto Scaling with the minimum capacity as 2 and the desired capacity as 2.
       The user is trying to terminate one of the existing instance with the command:
       as-terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group<Instance ID> --decrement-desired-capacity
       What will Auto Scaling do in this scenario?

       A. Terminates the instance and does not launch a new instance
       B. Terminates the instance and updates the desired capacity to 1
       C. Terminates the instance and updates the desired capacity and minimum size to 1
       D. Throws an error

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       The Auto Scaling command as-terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group <Instance ID>
       will terminate the specific instance ID. The user is required to specify the parameter as
       --decrement-desiredcapacity. Then Auto Scaling will terminate the instance and decrease the desired
        capacity by 1. In this case since the minimum size is 2, Auto Scaling will not allow the desired 
        capacity to go below 2. Thus, it will throw an error.

   QUESTION NO: 265

       A user is collecting 1000 records per second. The user wants to send the data to
       CloudWatch using the custom namespace. Which of the below mentioned options is recommended 
       for this activity?

       A. Aggregate the data with statistics, such as Min, max, Average, Sum and Sample data and
          send the data to CloudWatch
       B. Send all the data values to CloudWatch in a single command by separating them with a comma.
          CloudWatch will parse automatically
       C. Create one csv file of all the data and send a single file to CloudWatch
       D. It is not possible to send all the data in one call. Thus, it should be sent one by one.
          CloudWatch will aggregate the data automatically

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       AWS CloudWatch supports the custom metrics. The user can always capture the custom data and
       upload the data to CloudWatch using CLI or APIs. The user can publish data to CloudWatch as
       single data points or as an aggregated set of data points called a statistic set using the command
       put-metric-data. It is recommended that when the user is having multiple data points per minute, he
       should aggregate the data so that it will minimize the number of calls to put-metric-data. In this
       case it will be single call to CloudWatch instead of 1000 calls if the data is aggregated.

   QUESTION NO: 266

       A user is trying to create an EBS volume with the highest PIOPS supported by EBS. What is the
       minimum size of EBS required to have the maximum IOPS?

       A. 124
       B. 150
       C. 134
       D. 128

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       A provisioned IOPS EBS volume can range in size from 10 GB to 1 TB and the user can
       provision up to 4000 IOPS per volume. The ratio of IOPS provisioned to the volume size
       requested should be a maximum of 30.

   QUESTION NO: 267

       An organization is trying to create various IAM users. Which of the below mentioned options is not
       a valid IAM username?

       A. John.cloud
       B. john@cloud
       C. John=cloud
       D. john#cloud

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       AWS Identity and Access Management is a web service which allows organizations to manage
       users and user permissions for various AWS services. Whenever the organization is creating an
       IAM user, there should be a unique ID for each user. The names of users, groups, roles, instance
       profiles must be alphanumeric, including the following common characters: plus (+., equal (=.,
       comma (,., period (.., at (@., and dash (-..

   QUESTION NO: 268

       A user is having data generated randomly based on a certain event. The user wants to upload that
       data to CloudWatch. It may happen that event may not have data generated for some period due to
       andomness. Which of the below mentioned options is a recommended option for this case?

       A. For the period when there is no data, the user should not send the data at all
       B. For the period when there is no data the user should send a blank value
       C. For the period when there is no data the user should send the value as 0
       D. The user must upload the data to CloudWatch as having no data for some period will cause
          an error at CloudWatch monitoring

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       AWS CloudWatch supports the custom metrics. The user can always capture the custom data
       and upload the data to CloudWatch using CLI or APIs. When the user data is more random and
       not generated at regular intervals, there can be a period which has no associated data. The user
       can either publish the zero (0. Value for that period or not publish the data at all. It is
       recommended that the user should publish zero instead of no value to monitor the health of the
       application. This is helpful in an alarm as well as in the generation of the sample data count.

   QUESTION NO: 269

       A user is sending the data to CloudWatch using the CloudWatch API. The user is sending data 90
       minutes in the future. What will CloudWatch do in this case?

       A. CloudWatch will accept the data
       B. It is not possible to send data of the future
       C. It is not possible to send the data manually to CloudWatch
       D. The user cannot send data for more than 60 minutes in the future

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       With Amazon CloudWatch, each metric data point must be marked with a time stamp. The user
       can send the data using CLI but the time has to be in the UTC format. If the user does not provide
       the time, CloudWatch will take the data received time in the UTC timezone. The time stamp sent
       by the user can be up to two weeks in the past and up to two hours into the future.

       the error log, slow querylog, and general logs. RDS does not support viewing the transaction logs.

   QUESTION NO: 272

       A user has launched an EBS backed EC2 instance in the US-East-1a region. The user stopped
       the instance and started it back after 20 days. AWS throws up an ‘InsufficientInstanceCapacity’
       error. What can be the possible reason for this?

       A. AWS does not have sufficient capacity in that availability zone
       B. AWS zone mapping is changed for that user account
       C. There is some issue with the host capacity on which the instance is launched
       D. The user account has reached the maximum EC2 instance limit

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       When the user gets an ‘InsufficientInstanceCapacity’ error while launching or starting an EC2
       instance, it means that AWS does not currently have enough available capacity to service the user
       request. If the user is requesting a large number of instances, there might not be enough server
       capacity to host them. The user can either try again later, by specifying a smaller number of 
       instances or changing the availability zone if launching a fresh instance.

   QUESTION NO: 273

       A user has created a VPC with public and private subnets using the VPC wizard. Which of the
       below mentioned statements is true in this scenario?

       A. The AWS VPC will automatically create a NAT instance with the micro size
       B. VPC bounds the main route table with a private subnet and a custom route table with a
          public subnet
       C. The user has to manually create a NAT instance
       D. VPC bounds the main route table with a public subnet and a custom route table with a
          private subnet

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC. is a virtual network dedicated to the user’s AWS account. A user
       can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. If the user has created a
       public private subnet, the instances in the public subnet can receive inbound traffic directly from
       the internet, whereas the instances in the private subnet cannot. If these subnets are created with
       Wizard, AWS will create a NAT instance of a smaller or higher size, respectively. The VPC has an
       implied router and the VPC wizard updates the main route table used with the private subnet,
       creates a custom route table and associates it with the public subnet.

       An organization has created 10 IAM users. The organization wants each of the IAM users to
       have access to a separate DyanmoDB table. All the users are added to the same group and the
       organization wants to setup a group level policy for this. How can the organization achieve this?

       A. Define the group policy and add a condition which allows the access based on the IAM name
       B. Create a DynamoDB table with the same name as the IAM user name and define the policy rule
          which grants access based on the DynamoDB ARN using a variable
       C. Create a separate DynamoDB database for each user and configure a policy in the group based
          on the DB variable.
       D. It is not possible to have a group level policy which allows different IAM users to different
          DynamoDB Tables.

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       AWS Identity and Access Management is a web service which allows organizations to manage
       users and user permissions for various AWS services. AWS DynamoDB has only tables and the
       organization cannot makeseparate databases. The organization should create a table with the
       same name as the IAM user name and use the ARN of DynamoDB as part of the group policy.
       The sample policy is shown below:
       {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [{
       169
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Action": ["dynamodb:*"],
       "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:region:account-number-without-hyphens:table/

       A user has configured an HTTPS listener on an ELB. The user has not configured any security
       policy which can help to negotiate SSL between the client and ELB. What will ELB do in this
       scenario?

       A. By default ELB will select the first version of the security policy
       B. By default ELB will select the latest version of the policy
       C. ELB creation will fail without a security policy
       D. It is not required to have a security policy since SSL is already installed

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       Elastic Load Balancing uses a Secure Socket Layer (SSL. negotiation configuration which
       is known as a Security Policy. It is used to negotiate the SSL connections between a client and
       the loadbalancer. If the user has created an HTTPS/SSL listener without associating any security
       policy, Elastic Load Balancing will, bydefault, associate the latest version of the
       ELBSecurityPolicyYYYY-MM with the load balancer.

       A user is creating a Cloudformation stack. Which of the below mentioned limitations does not hold
       true for Cloudformation?

       A. One account by default is limited to 100 templates
       B. The user can use 60 parameters and 60 outputs in a single template
       C. The template, parameter, output, and resource description fields are limited to 4096 characters
       D. One account by default is limited to 20 stacks

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       AWS Cloudformation is an application management tool which provides application modelling,
       deployment, configuration, management and related activities. The limitations given below apply
       to the Cloudformation template and stack. There are no limits to the number of templates but each

   QUESTION NO: 278

       A user has two EC2 instances running in two separate regions. The user is running an
       internal memory management tool, which captures the data and sends it to CloudWatch in US East,
       using a CLI with the same namespace and metric. Which of the below mentioned options is true with
       respect to the above statement?

       A. The setup will not work as CloudWatch cannot receive data across regions
       B. CloudWatch will receive and aggregate the data based on the namespace and metric
       C. CloudWatch will give an error since the data will conflict due to two sources
       D. CloudWatch will take the data of the server, which sends the data first

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       Amazon CloudWatch does not differentiate the source of a metric when receiving custom data. If
       the user is publishing a metric with the same namespace and dimensions from different sources,
       CloudWatch will treat them as a single metric. If the data is coming with the same timezone within
       a minute, CloudWatch will aggregate the data. It treats these as a single metric, allowing the user
       to get the statistics, such as minimum, maximum, average, and the sum of all across all servers.

       An organization has created a Queue named “modularqueue” with SQS. The organization is not
       performing any operations such as SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, DeleteMessage,
       GetQueueAttributes, SetQueueAttributes, AddPermission, and RemovePermission on the queue.
       What can happen in this scenario?

       A. AWS SQS sends notification after 15 days for inactivity on queue
       B. AWS SQS can delete queue after 30 days without notification
       C. AWS SQS marks queue inactive after 30 days
       D. AWS SQS notifies the user after 2 weeks and deletes the queue after 3 weeks.

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       Amazon SQS can delete a queue without notification if one of the following actions hasn't
       been performed on it for 30 consecutive days: SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, DeleteMessage, 
       GetQueueAttributes, SetQueueAttributes, AddPermission, and RemovePermission.

       An organization has setup Auto Scaling with ELB. Due to some manual error, one of the instances
       got rebooted. Thus, it failed the Auto Scaling health check. Auto Scaling has marked it for
       replacement. How can the system admin ensure that the instance does not get terminated?

       A. Update the Auto Scaling group to ignore the instance reboot event
       B. It is not possible to change the status once it is marked for replacement
       C. Manually add that instance to the Auto Scaling group after reboot to avoid replacement
       D. Change the health of the instance to healthy using the Auto Scaling commands

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       After an instance has been marked unhealthy by Auto Scaling, as a result of an Amazon EC2 or
       ELB health check, it is almost immediately scheduled for replacement as it will never
       automatically recover its health. If the user knows that the instance is healthy then he can
       manually call the SetInstanceHealth action (or the as-setinstance- health command from CLI. to
       set the instance's health status back to healthy. Auto Scaling will throw an error if the instance is
       already terminating or else it will mark it healthy.

       A user is planning to scale up an application by 8 AM and scale down by 7 PM daily using
       Auto Scaling. What should the user do in this case?

       A. Setup the scaling policy to scale up and down based on the CloudWatch alarms
       B. The user should increase the desired capacity at 8 AM and decrease it by 7 PM manually
       C. The user should setup a batch process which launches the EC2 instance at a specific time
       D. Setup scheduled actions to scale up or down at a specific time

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       Auto Scaling based on a schedule allows the user to scale the application in response to
       predictable load changes. To configure the Auto Scaling group to scale based on a schedule,
       the user needs to create scheduled actions. A scheduled action tells Auto Scaling to perform
       a scaling action at a certain time in the future.

       A user has configured ELB with Auto Scaling. The user suspended the Auto Scaling AddToLoadBalancer
       (which adds instances to the load balancer. process for a while. What will happen to the instances
       launched during the suspension period?

       A. The instances will not be registered with ELB and the user has to manually register when
          the process is resumed
       B. The instances will be registered with ELB only once the process has resumed
       C. Auto Scaling will not launch the instance during this period due to process suspension
       D. It is not possible to suspend only the AddToLoadBalancer process

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       Auto Scaling performs various processes, such as Launch, Terminate, add to Load Balancer etc.
       The user can also suspend the individual process. The AddToLoadBalancer process type adds
       instances to the load balancer when the instances are launched. If this process is suspended,
       Auto Scaling will launch the instances but will not add them to the load balancer. When the user
       resumes this process, Auto Scaling will resume adding new instances launched after resumption
       to the load balancer. However, it will not add running instances that were launched while the
       process was suspended; those instances must be added manually.

   QUESTION NO: 287

       A sys admin has enabled a log on ELB. Which of the below mentioned activities are not
       captured by the log?

       A. Response processing time
       B. Front end processing time
       C. Backend processing time
       D. Request processing time

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       Elastic Load Balancing access logs capture detailed information for all the requests made to the
       load balancer. Each request will have details, such as client IP, request path, ELB IP, time, and
       latencies. The time will have information, such as Request Processing time, Backend
       Processing time and Response Processing time.

   QUESTION NO: 288

       A user has moved an object to Glacier using the life cycle rules. The user requests to restore the
       archive after 6 months. When the restore request is completed the user accesses that archive.
       Which of the below mentioned statements is not true in this condition?

       A. The archive will be available as an object for the duration specified by the user during
          the restoration request
       B. The restored object’s storage class will be RRS
       C. The user can modify the restoration period only by issuing a new restore request with
          the updated period
       D. The user needs to pay storage for both RRS (restored) and Glacier (Archive) Rates.

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       AWS Glacier is an archival service offered by AWS. AWS S3 provides lifecycle rules to archive
       and restore objects from S3 to Glacier. Once the object is archived their storage class will change
       to Glacier. If the user sends a request for restore, the storage class will still be Glacier for the
       restored object. The user will be paying for both the archived copy as well as for the restored
       object. The object is available only for the duration specified in the restore request and if the user
       wants to modify that period, he has to raise another restore request with the updated duration.

   QUESTION NO: 289

       A user is running a batch process on EBS backed EC2 instances. The batch process starts a few
       instances to process hadoop Map reduce jobs which can run between 50 – 600 minutes or
       sometimes for more time. The user wants to configure that the instance gets terminated only
       when the process is completed. How can the user configure this with CloudWatch?

       A. Setup the CloudWatch action to terminate the instance when the CPU utilization is less
          than 5%
       B. Setup the CloudWatch with Auto Scaling to terminate all the instances
       C. Setup a job which terminates all instances after 600 minutes
       D. It is not possible to terminate instances automatically

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       Amazon CloudWatch alarm watches a single metric over a time period that the user specifies
       and performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold
       over a number of time periods. The user can setup an action which terminates the instances
       when their CPU utilization is below a certain threshold for a certain period of time. The EC2
       action can either terminate or stop the instance as part of the EC2 action.

   QUESTION NO: 290

       A user has enabled versioning on an S3 bucket. The user is using server side encryption for
       data at rest. If the user is supplying his own keys for encryption (SSE-C., what is recommended
       to the user for the purpose of security?

       A. The user should not use his own security key as it is not secure
       B. Configure S3 to rotate the user’s encryption key at regular intervals
       C. Configure S3 to store the user’s keys securely with SSL
       D. Keep rotating the encryption key manually at the client side

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       AWS S3 supports client side or server side encryption to encrypt all data at Rest. The server side
       encryption can either have the S3 supplied AES-256 encryption key or the user can send the key
       along with each API call to supply his own encryption key (SSE-C.. Since S3 does not store the
       encryption keys in SSE-C, it is recommended that the user should manage keys securely and
       keep rotating them regularly at the client side version.

   QUESTION NO: 291

       A user runs the command “dd if=/dev/xvdf of=/dev/null bs=1M” on an EBS volume created from a
       snapshot and attached to a Linux instance. Which of the below mentioned activities is the user
       performing with the step given above?

       A. Pre warming the EBS volume
       B. Initiating the device to mount on the EBS volume
       C. Formatting the volume
       D. Copying the data from a snapshot to the device

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       When the user creates an EBS volume and is trying to access it for the first time it will encounter
       reduced IOPS due to wiping or initiating of the block storage. To avoid this as well as achieve the
       best performance it is required to pre warm the EBS volume. For a volume created from a
       snapshot and attached with a Linux OS, the “dd” command pre warms the existing data on EBS
       and any restored snapshots of volumes that have been previously fully pre warmed. This
       command maintains incremental snapshots; however, because this operation is read-only, it does
       not pre warm unused space that has never been written to on the original volume. In the
       command “dd if=/dev/xvdf of=/dev/null bs=1M” , the parameter “if=input file” should be set to the
       drive that the user wishes to warm. The “of=output file” parameter should be set to the Linux null
       virtual device, /dev/null. The “bs” parameter sets the block size of the read operation; for optimal
       performance, this should be set to 1 MB.

   QUESTION NO: 292

       A user has launched an EC2 Windows instance from an instance store backed AMI. The user
       wants to convert the AMI to an EBS backed AMI. How can the user convert it?

       A. Attach an EBS volume to the instance and unbundle all the AMI bundled data inside the EBS
       B. A Windows based instance store backed AMI cannot be converted to an EBS backed AMI
       C. It is not possible to convert an instance store backed AMI to an EBS backed AMI
       D. Attach an EBS volume and use the copy command to copy all the ephermal content to the EBS
          Volume

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       Generally when a user has launched an EC2 instance from an instance store backed AMI, it can
       be converted to an EBS backed AMI provided the user has attached the EBS volume to the
       instance and unbundles the AMI data to it. However, if the instance is a Windows instance, AWS
       does not allow this. In this case, since the instance is a Windows instance, the user cannot
       convert it to an EBS backed AMI.

       Explanation:
       A user can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. If the user has
       created a public private subnet, the instances in the public subnet can receive inbound traffic
       directly from the Internet, whereas the instances in the private subnet cannot. If these subnets are
       created with Wizard, AWS will create two route tables and attach to the subnets. The main route
       table will have the entry “Destination: 20.0.0.0/24 and Target:
       Local”, which allows all instances in the VPC to communicate with each other.

   QUESTION NO: 294

       A sysadmin has created the below mentioned policy on an S3 bucket named cloudacademy. The
       bucket has both AWS.jpg and index.html objects. What does this policy define?
       "Statement": [{
       "Sid": "Stmt1388811069831",
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": { "AWS": "*"},
       "Action": [ "s3:GetObjectAcl", "s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetObject"],
       "Resource": [ "arn:aws:s3:::cloudacademy/*.jpg]
       }]

       A. It will make all the objects as well as the bucket public
       B. It will throw an error for the wrong action and does not allow to save the policy
       C. It will make the AWS.jpg object as public
       D. It will make the AWS.jpg as well as the cloudacademy bucket as public

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       A sysadmin can grant permission to the S3 objects or the buckets to any user or make objects
       public using the bucket policy and user policy. Both use the JSON-based access policy
       language. Generally if user is defining the ACL on the bucket, the objects in the bucket do not
       inherit it and vice a versa. The bucket policy can be defined at the bucket level which allows the
       objects as well as the bucket to be public with a single policy applied to that bucket. In the below
       policy the action says “S3:ListBucket” for effect Allow and when there is no bucket name
       mentioned as a part of the resource, it will throw an error and not save the policy.
       "Statement": [{
       "Sid": "Stmt1388811069831",
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": { "AWS": "*"},
       "Action": [ "s3:GetObjectAcl", "s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetObject"],
       "Resource": [ "arn:aws:s3:::cloudacademy/*.jpg]
       }]

   QUESTION NO: 295

       A user has launched an EC2 instance and deployed a production application in it. The user wants
       to prohibit any mistakes from the production team to avoid accidental termination. How can the
       user achieve this?

       A. The user can the set DisableApiTermination attribute to avoid accidental termination
       B. It is not possible to avoid accidental termination
       C. The user can set the Deletion termination flag to avoid accidental termination
       D. The user can set the InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior flag to avoid accidental termination

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       It is always possible that someone can terminate an EC2 instance using the Amazon EC2
       console, command line interface or API by mistake. If the admin wants to prevent the instance
       from being accidentally terminated, he can enable termination protection for that instance. The
       DisableApiTermination attribute controls whether the instance can be terminated using the
       console, CLI or API. By default, termination protection is disabled for an EC2 instance. When it
       is set it will not allow the user to terminate the instance from CLI, API or the console.

   QUESTION NO: 296

       A user has created a launch configuration for Auto Scaling where CloudWatch detailed monitoring
       is disabled. The user wants to now enable detailed monitoring. How can the user achieve this?

       A. Update the Launch config with CLI to set InstanceMonitoringDisabled = false
       B. The user should change the Auto Scaling group from the AWS console to enable
          detailed monitoring
       C. Update the Launch config with CLI to set InstanceMonitoring.Enabled = true
       D. Create a new Launch Config with detail monitoring enabled and update the Auto Scaling group

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS as well as the custom services. To enable detailed instance
       monitoring for a new Auto Scaling group, the user does not need to take any extra steps. When
       the user creates the AutoScaling launch config as the first step for creating an Auto Scaling
       group, each launch configuration contains a flag named InstanceMonitoring.Enabled. The default
       value of this flag is true. When the user has created a launch configuration with
       InstanceMonitoring.Enabled = false it will involve multiple steps to enable detail monitoring. The
       steps are:
       Create a new Launch config with detailed monitoring enabled
       Update the Auto Scaling group with a new launch config
       Enable detail monitoring on each EC2 instance

   QUESTION NO: 297

       A user is trying to pre-warm a blank EBS volume attached to a Linux instance. Which of the below
       mentioned steps should be performed by the user?

       A. There is no need to pre-warm an EBS volume
       B. Contact AWS support to pre-warm
       C. Unmount the volume before pre-warming
       D. Format the device

       Answer: C

       Explanation:
       When the user creates a new EBS volume or restores a volume from the snapshot, the backend storage
       blocks are immediately allocated to the user EBS. However, the first time when the user is trying
       to access a block of the storage, it is recommended to either be wiped from the new volumes or
       instantiated from the snapshot (for restored volumes. before the user can access the block. This
       preliminary action takes time and can cause a 5 to 50 percent loss of IOPS for the volume when
       the block is accessed for the first time. To avoid this it is required to pre warm the volume.
       Prewarming an EBS volume on a Linux instance requires that the user should unmount the blank
       device first and then write all the blocks on the device using a command, such as “dd”.

   QUESTION NO: 298

       A user has launched an EC2 instance from an instance store backed AMI. The user has attached
       an additional instance store volume to the instance. The user wants to create an AMI from the
       running instance. Will the AMI have the additional instance store volume data?

       A. Yes, the block device mapping will have information about the additional instance store volume
       B. No, since the instance store backed AMI can have only the root volume bundled
       C. It is not possible to attach an additional instance store volume to the existing instance
          store backed AMI instance
       D. No, since this is ephermal storage it will not be a part of the AMI

       Answer: A

       Explanation:
       When the user has launched an EC2 instance from an instance store backed AMI and added an
       instance store volume to the instance in addition to the root device volume, the block device
       mapping for the new AMI contains the information for these volumes as well. In addition, the
       block device mappings for the instances those are launched from the new AMI will automatically
       contain information for these volumes.

   QUESTION NO: 299

       A user has created an EBS volume of 10 GB and attached it to a running instance. The user is
       trying to access EBS for first time. Which of the below mentioned options is the correct statement
       with respect to a first time EBS access?

       A. The volume will show a size of 8 GB
       B. The volume will show a loss of the IOPS performance the first time
       C. The volume will be blank
       D. If the EBS is mounted it will ask the user to create a file system

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       A user can create an EBS volume either from a snapshot or as a blank volume. If the volume is
       from a snapshot it will not be blank. The volume shows the right size only as long as it is 
       mounted. This shows that the file system is created. When the user is accessing the volume the
       AWS EBS will wipe out the block storage or instantiate from the snapshot. Thus, the volume will
       show a loss of IOPS. It is recommended that the user should pre warm the EBS before use to 
       achieve better IO.

   QUESTION NO: 300

       A user has enabled termination protection on an EC2 instance. The user has also set
       Instance initiated shutdown behaviour to terminate. When the user shuts down the instance 
       from the OS, what will happen?

       A. The OS will shutdown but the instance will not be terminated due to protection
       B. It will terminate the instance
       C. It will not allow the user to shutdown the instance from the OS
       D. It is not possible to set the termination protection when an Instance initiated shutdown is
          set to Terminate

       Answer: B

       Explanation:
       It is always possible that someone can terminate an EC2 instance using the Amazon EC2
       console, command line interface or API by mistake. If the admin wants to prevent the instance
       from being accidentally terminated, he can enable termination protection for that instance. The
       user can also setup shutdown behaviour for an EBS backed instance to guide the instance on
       what should be done when he initiates shutdown from the OS using Instance initiated shutdown
       behaviour. If the instance initiated behaviour is set to terminate and the user shuts off the OS
       even though termination protection is enabled, it will still terminate the instance.

   QUESTION NO: 301

       A user has deployed an application on an EBS backed EC2 instance. For a better performance of
       application, it requires dedicated EC2 to EBS traffic. How can the user achieve this?

       A. Launch the EC2 instance as EBS dedicated with PIOPS EBS
       B. Launch the EC2 instance as EBS enhanced with PIOPS EBS
       C. Launch the EC2 instance as EBS dedicated with PIOPS EBS
       D. Launch the EC2 instance as EBS optimized with PIOPS EBS

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       Any application which has performance sensitive workloads and requires minimal variability with
       dedicated EC2 to EBS traffic should use provisioned IOPS EBS volumes, which are attached to
       an EBS-optimized EC2 instance or it should use an instance with 10 Gigabit network connectivity.
       Launching an instance that is EBSoptimized provides the user with a dedicated connection
       between the EC2 instance and the EBS volume.

   QUESTION NO: 302

       A user has launched a Windows based EC2 instance. However, the instance has some issues
       and the user wants to check the log. When the user checks the Instance console output from the
       AWS console, what will it display?

       A. All the event logs since instance boot
       B. The last 10 system event log error
       C. The Windows instance does not support the console output
       D. The last three system events’ log errors

       Answer: D

       Explanation:
       The AWS EC2 console provides a useful tool called Console output for problem diagnosis. It is
       useful to find out any kernel issues, termination reasons or service configuration issues. For a
       Windows instance it lists the last three system event log errors. For Linux it displays the exact
       console output.
